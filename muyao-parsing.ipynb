      "line is: First, my annual clarification: this selection of science fiction stories represents the best that was publised during the year 1997. In my opinion I could perhaps have filled two more volumes this size and then claimed to have nearly all of the best—though not all the best novellas.\n",
      "line is: Second, the general criteria: this book is full of science fiction—every story in the book is clearly that and not something else. I personally have a high regard for horror, fantasy, speculative fiction, and slipstream and postmodern literature. But here, I choose science fiction. It is the intention of this year's best series to focus entirely on science fiction, and to provide readers who are looking especially for science fiction an annual home base.\n",
      "line is: All the trends mentioned in last year's introduction continued in 1997: the magazines continued to lose circulation but still publish the lion's share of the best stories in the SF field; original anthologies remained mediocre, with honorable exceptions that gathered stories often better than all but the best magazine stories. I'll discuss some of them below. And the best stories were most often short, novelettes or shorts according to Hugo or Nebula Award rules (just plain short stories according to the standards of non-genre literature). 1997 was not a great year for novellas.\n",
      "line is: SF Age emerged as a leader among the magazines for high quality science fiction, though Asimov's and Fantasy & Science Fiction and Interzone continued strong. It was a particularly good year for Asimov's, and there were a number of talented new writers in Interzone. There were some consolidations in the publishing industry, some cutbacks in paperbacks, but they were offset by an extraordinary increase in the number of trade paperback titles. 1997 was the year of the trade paperback in SF, with Del Rey alone issuing fifty or more titles of its extensive fantasy and SF backlist in trade paperback\n",
      "line is: I have several hot tips for readers. You may well have missed three of the best (maybe three of the four year's best—the only other leading contender is Linaweaver & Kramer's Free Space, which was reviewed widely and attracted many Nebula story nominations) original science fiction anthologies of the year: Decalog 5, New Worlds, and Future Histories. All of these books appeared uhexpectedly and without advance warning and I only saw them at first by accident. They helped make it a particularly good year for anthologies in general.\n",
      "line is: Decalog is the fifth in a series and is suddenly distinguished (after four previous volumes that were not— the first two were filled with unmemorable Dr. Who stories!). This one, however, has originals by Stephen Baxter, Dominic Green, Ian Watson, and others, all set in the far future. A good book in any year. Editor David Garnett's latest New Worlds appeared as a trade paperback original from White Wolf with no fanfare and is in my opinion the best original anthology of the year, including new stories by William Gibson, Michael Moorcock, Brian Aldiss, Kim Newman, Ian Watson, and many others—some SF, some speculative ficton, as you would expect. If there is such a thing as good old fashioned New Worlds at its best, this it it. Editor Stephen McClelland's Future Histories is a trade paperback published in the UK (only?) by Horizon House and Nokia, full of original stories by such writers as Nancy Kress, Gregory Benford, Pat Cadigan, Stephen Baxter, Pat Murphy, Brian Stableford (and interview with Sterling, Bear Gibson, Stephenson, Vernor Vinge, Alexander Besher, and others). The theme is \"Twenty Tomorrows for Communications\"—a corporate anthology, by golly, but done extremely well.\n",
      "line is: There was the usual, sad to say, glut of mediocre original anthologies, many with one or two good stories, but most a bit below the acceptable level for the professinal magazines. The same level maintained for the semiprogessional magazines in 1997, though the good story balance there was a higher percentage than in the anthologies.\n",
      "line is: On the whole, it was another year in which there were in the end more than fifty, perhaps a hundred, really good SF stories published, certainly enough to fill several Year's Best volumes, providing me with a rich diversity of selection for this one.\n",
      "line is: Comments on thematic trends in the literature I have saved for the notes to the stories, that follow immediately. Let's get to them now.\n",
      "line is: Gene Wolfe's body of work over the years is a challenge and a delight to serious readers of science fiction. This year, as in the past, there were several fine Wolfe stories to choose from for this volume, but this one, published in a paperback original anthology of lightweight pieces on the theme, Return of the Dinosaurs, seemed to me just the thing to lead off a Year's Best volume, in a year when dinosaurs on film and TV are in vogue. There has been a fair amount of disagreement in recent years as to what makes a good SF story and in what way such characteristics as plot and action, character or idea ought or ought not to be central to the enterprise of science fiction story-telling. In my opinion, each good story implicitly makes its own statement and influences the argument it its own favor. And so the literature evolves. This is a cracking good story with subtle, and some quite clear, implications. But never mind that for now; read this slick, fast piece for fun and surprises and then stop and think afterward: what might it mean if the dinosaurs came back as Barney?\n",

      "line is: STACEY SHOULD HAVE run as soon as she saw the security guard's golf cart barreling toward her. That's what fugitives do, right? They run. But Stacey didn't feel like a criminal just yet. Her instincts were still those of a law-abiding citizen. Weird how your life can change in the matter of minutes, she mused. This morning she was the girl most likely to succeed. Now her name was trending with the hashtag #LockHerUp.\n",
      "line is: Sammy brought his golf cart to a screeching halt in front of her. What a ridiculous vehicle to give a man who was over six feet tall, and three hundred pounds. His hulking frame filled the two front seats, and he had to drive with his left leg dangling outside the cart's floorboard.\n",
      "line is: \"I found her,\" he said roughly into his walkie-talkie. The thing looked like a flip phone in his giant hands.\n",
      "line is: Stacey had taken refuge on a bench outside the history building—a fitting place for someone with no future. These open spaces used to be ugly concrete pathways, the freeways of Lincoln High School, where students moved en masse from one class to another. It was Stacey who advocated that the school beautify these barren thoroughfares with trees, bushes, and flowers. Now the campus was filled with tiny parklets that provided quiet, contemplative spaces for students to reflect on the ruin they had brought to their lives.\n",
      "line is: Stacey stood up and attempted to repair her damaged appearance. After the wrestling match in the quad, her pale skin had the texture of a sneaker sole. There was a wad of chewing gum stuck to the back pocket of her shorts. Her blond hair could be cast in a Mad Max movie. She tried to fix these defects by giving herself a preemptive pat down. All that did was kick up the dust and debris that had settled on her skin and clothes.\n",
      "line is: She wondered briefly if Sammy would take her in cuffs.\n",
      "line is: \"I'll just get in the back,\" Stacey said, walking around Sammy and hopping onto the back seat. She wasn't going to fight this. She was tired of fighting. It wasn't just the brawl at brunch either. The whole election had exhausted her. She didn't realize how much until she had escaped to her bench after everyone had gone back to class. The quiet was intoxicating. She couldn't remember the last time she had sat still like that and cleared her mind of every item on her to-do list.\n",
      "line is: The back seat of the golf cart faced away from the driver. Stacey watched her sanctuary recede into the distance as Sammy drove down the covered hallway toward the main office. The walls on either side of her were still decorated with campaign posters urging students to vote in today's election. Stacey noticed that someone had torn down parts of the banner she'd hung next to the bathrooms in the English wing. Now instead of reading _Don't Waste Your Vote! Elect Stacey Wynn_ , it read _Waste Stacey Wynn_. That wasn't very comforting. She pulled out her phone and checked the chatter on her social media feeds to see if anyone else was advocating assassination. Nope. Most were divided between calling her a bully and calling her a badass, but no one wanted to kill her.\n",
      "line is: The hallway dumped them onto the main quad, the heart of the campus, where the cafeteria, library, auditorium, and main office were located. The patchwork of lawns was still littered with debris, which the seagulls and crows huddled around like hungry Costco shoppers at a sampling tray. Along with the usual garbage that kids left after eating their morning snacks, Stacey saw a dropped poster with the words _Amor sin Fronteras_ on the front. Someone from Julia's crew must have abandoned it when the fight broke out, which would make sense. It wouldn't look right to bash someone over the head with a sign saying love knows no boundaries.\n",
      "line is: A few feet away, Stacey spied that stupid astronaut helmet Tony wore over his cow costume. The cheap plastic orb had cracked down the middle; probably the result of Julia yanking it off his head and hurling it into the crowd. Stacey turned around to ask Sammy if he wanted to collect it as evidence, but then stopped herself. It's not like the helmet was a smoking gun. If anything was responsible for the mayhem, it was these guns, Stacey thought, staring at her muscular calves. Ten years of Tae Kwon Do training had left her with beautifully toned legs. Even scraped and bruised, they were by far her best feature. And most lethal weapon.\n",
      "line is: Sammy parked in front of the administrative building and escorted Stacey to the principal's office. Stacey had been in Buckley's office plenty of times in her three years at Lincoln, but she was always invited in as a consultant, rather than perp walked in as a violent criminal. The administration had often asked Stacey to help organize or promote some school event, and she had always been happy to do it. She hoped Buckley would give her a pass in light of her good behavior. At the very least, she hoped Buckley wouldn't call her mother and tell her what had happened. If Mom suspected Stacey was venturing into a life of crime, she might force her to live with her and her new husband, so they could instill more discipline into her upbringing.\n",

      "line is: The house where Hari worked was in the center of New Delhi, near a lot of government bungalows and embassy residences. Hari got the job through his father's cousin whose son-in-law was the driver. Every day Hari dusted the shelves, washed the floor, arranged whatever papers had accumulated on the tables. There wasn't much to do; his employers, the Calloways, never had parties. Hari had initially looked forward to wearing a white suit and proffering drinks on a silver tray, as did his cousin Ranjit who worked for the French consul general, but that never happened. Once in a great while two or three people came for dinner or drinks, and when they did the Calloways paid no attention to the servants' clothes.\n",
      "line is: Mrs. Calloway was a journalist for an English newspaper. She preferred Pakistan. She said people in Lahore gave better parties and \"didn't talk from both sides of their mouths.\" Hari couldn't figure out what the husband did; he told dinner guests he was writing a book about the Punjab, but he never went up to the library, neither did he use his typewriter. Hari knew this because it was his job to dust the library, and the typewriter never came out from under its plastic dustcover and there was never any paper in the wastebasket. From what Hari observed, Mr. Calloway spent most of his time reading magazines and eating grilled cheese sandwiches on the bersati.\n",
      "line is: Hari lived in the dormitory behind the house with the other servants—a chowkidar, a dhobi, and Harmeet the cook. Over the years Harmeet had worked for various embassies and high commissions, and thus claimed to speak Italian, French, Danish, and \"Brazilian,\" which he had putatively studied during his four-year tenure at the Brazilian Embassy. One night the Calloways had a Brazilian demographer to dinner. They summoned Harmeet from the kitchen so the two could have a conversation. Hari watched from the doorway. He knew Harmeet didn't understand what the man was saying, but Harmeet invented a story line which was well received by the guest. When Harmeet was finally released, he ran into the kitchen, sweat streaming down his forehead, and yelled at Hari to get the dessert trays ready.\n",
      "line is: Harmeet was willfully obsequious in the Calloways' presence, but when alone with the other servants, he recounted calumnious tales of Mr. Calloway's sexual habits. Hari consequently studied his employer with fierce curiosity, but the only noticeably peculiar thing Mr. Calloway ever did was to entertain a middle-aged Australian woman when Mrs. Calloway was out of town. Harmeet muttered about what they did when they were alone, but as far as Hari could see nothing much went on; they sat in the living room, smoked cigarettes, and drank whiskey sodas. The woman always left promptly at 12:30 P.M. Mr. Calloway turned out the lights in the living room, locked the front door, and went to bed. It was strange that the woman never came when Mrs. Calloway was there, but it was also strange that Mrs. Calloway was always traveling. Hari soon gave up speculating about Mr. Calloway's private life, and concentrated on pilfering chocolates and liqueurs, fishing European magazines out of the trash, and staying up late reading and eating in his room.\n",
      "line is: After Hari got the job in Delhi, his mother stopped pestering him about marriage. But when a year had passed she sent a photograph of her candidate. Hari was disappointed, the girl had huge eyebrows, a double chin, and bulbous cheeks sprinkled with acne. Hari calculated he could forestall the inevitable for another year and a half.\n",
      "line is: After two years Mrs. Calloway was transferred to Jakarta and a new tenant moved in. His name was Bob Thompson, and he worked for the World Bank. He was, Hari supposed, quite handsome, with thick blond hair, pink and white skin, and very pale blue eyes with long eyelashes. The staff under the Calloways had adjusted to a pleasantly dilatory routine: Hari hadn't bothered to clean behind the shelves and couches for over a year. But Bob wanted everything washed and polished and maintained at the highest level of cleanliness and order. He had the living room painted pale blue, the bedroom yellow, the bathrooms beige; he brought in a team of tailors to reupholster all the furniture; he bought curtains, rugs, paintings, lamps, deluxe air conditioners, tablecloths. He bought new uniforms for everyone, put Harmeet's son Balban on the staff, and gave Hari lessons in mixing drinks and setting the table.\n",
      "line is: Bob had at least three dinner parties a week, a large cocktail party every fortnight, and a dance party once a month. Harmeet boasted to Bob of having worked twice as hard at the German Embassy, but when Bob dismissed them on late nights, Harmeet moaned that keeping long hours hurt his eyes and how his uncle had always warned him that the English were terrible masters. Hari was also daunted by the amount of work Bob's social life exacted; he'd grown accustomed to going to the cinema, sleeping late, playing cards in the garden at Khan Market. Now he was up at 6:30 and in bed at midnight.\n",
      "line is: But by far the most perplexing aspect of Bob's routine was that he saw several women in the course of a single week. Hari soon discerned three regulars. The first was Gerta, a stewardess from Lufthansa who always arrived at two in the morning in her flight uniform, pulling her portable luggage cart. The second was Joan, an English journalist who smoked and drank a lot and was always rude to the servants. Hari didn't think she was attractive at all—she wore round glasses and short skirts, which exposed thin, unshaven legs. Hari fantasized about spilling oil on her dough-colored thighs when he bent down to hand her the specially prepared gin and tonic she demanded. The third was Celeste, a Frenchwoman who'd come to Delhi fifteen years ago to study Bharatanatyam and teach ballet to the children of diplomats and businessmen. She wore nose rings, peasant skirts hiked up over dance leotards, piles of silver jewelry like a Gujjar nomad, and always carried a huge bag with clothes, ankle bells, notebooks, and incense. Of the three, Hari guessed that Celeste was the nicest because she wore Indian skirts.\n",
      "line is: The dhobi, who didn't speak any English, was severely taxed by the new demands on his time and skill, and had Hari translate when Bob called him in for laundry conferences. When Bob was out of town Hari went into the bedroom and tried on tuxedos, shoes, and silk shirts. He smelled Bob's cologne, tried his French cigarettes, used Bob's nail clipper and hairbrush. He then put on Bob's records and danced before the mirror, studying his reflection and his movements.\n",

It's kind of simple: I'm a character actor because I come from a family of characters. When people ask if anyone in my family is an actor, I say all of them. They're performative people. They'll star somewhat in this, in the way Mother and Father star in our lives, constantly—as constant as the northern star—but I'll take the lead.\n",

It's the pictures that got small.\" Now look how small the pictures have gotten on these freaking iPhone screens. The tiny screens have gotten into people's hands, and there's all this swiping going on, all this shoo-fly bullshit. In the nineties, we had big screens in the cinema and big TVs in our homes.

      "line is: SINCE the age of twelve or thirteen, Ichi had suffered from a recurrent eye infection with the coming of spring. She had forgotten about it lately, thanks to the change in her life created by her marriage to Shinzo Kugata. But shortly after the cherry trees at the castle had bloomed, her husband told her, \"Your eyes are red.\" When she looked at herself in the mirror, she saw that the ailment had indeed begun again. chi had suffered from a recurrent eye infection with the coming of spring. She had forgotten about it lately, thanks to the change in her life created by her marriage to Shinzo Kugata. But shortly after the cherry trees at the castle had bloomed, her husband told her, \"Your eyes are red.\" When she looked at herself in the mirror, she saw that the ailment had indeed begun again.\n",
      "line is: It could be said that she had weak eyes. If she devoted all her energy to sewing or read a book printed in small characters, her eyes would soon water or her eyelids begin to twitch. If she continued reading or sewing, it was not unusual for her vision to cloud, and she would be uncomfortable.\n",
      "line is: \"You'd better not sew any longer,\" Iso, her mother-in-law, told her. \"Your eyes are apt to be affected when you're expecting a baby, even if that's not the reason.\"\n",
      "line is: \"I've had eye trouble since I was small. It will somehow heal by itself if I can get through this season,\" Ichi answered.\n",
      "line is: Her reserved answer was a result of the constraint she still felt toward her mother-in-law, for she had been married only seven months. And yet, already Ichi had won a kind of self-confidence. Since she had become a member of the Kugata family she was enjoying every day ; her life was full of a high-spirited, cheerful atmosphere, and she could feel that her body and mind were unfettered. She felt as if something that had not budded while she was still with her parents had suddenly begun to blossom.\n",
      "line is: This might have been because her family's discipline had been too strict and also because, being an only daughter and the last of five children, she had been pampered by her family. By nature she was not very strong; because of her family's overindulgence, she had never had any confidence in her health and had come to fret over even the most minor ailments.\n",
      "line is: But things were quite different in the Kugata household. Her husband, Shinzo, her mother-in-law, Iso, and her brothers-in-law, Tatsuya and Kyunosuke, were easygoing, simple people and were seldom fussy about things. They were also very liberal, unusual for a samurai family, and never assumed a haughty attitude. It was a foregone conclusion that you would be encumbered with constant cares for a time after you married, and not even Ichi could say that she had not experienced this. But it was only for a short time, and as soon as she had become familiar with the personality of this family, she felt a relieved, easy feeling. She stopped catching colds easily, and her arms and legs began to grow plump. Certainly she would be able to recover from her chronic eye infection.\n",
      "line is: \"If you say so, all right. But please don't try too hard,\" her mother-in-law said, not forcing her to stop sewing.\n",
      "line is: That evening her brother-in-law Kyunosuke found out about her eyes and became excited.\n",
      "line is: \"You're too easygoing, mother. In general, newly married wives who are expecting a baby no longer have to sew. You should do the same, sister,\" he said, turning to Ichi. \"You'd better put away that fine work, and I seriously think you should go to a doctor soon.\"\n",
      "line is: \"You're very knowledgeable about such matters,\" Iso said as she looked smilingly at her third son. \"But what you're talking about has to do with the period after childbirth, doesn't it?\"\n",

      "line is: The year 2005 was a science-fictional year in several ways. Think, for instance of SF-scale catastrophes and post-catastrophe civilizations. We were just beginning to understand the scale of the tsunami as the year 2005 dawned. The sheer enormity was hard to grasp, much of it first comprehensible through satellite images of the Aceh coastline wiped clean and the churning vortices of the retreating wave on a few videos. The destruction of New Orleans was disaster come to us, not over there in places we might never have heard of, a disaster made at least as much by our own institutions as by nature, and of science-fictional scale. And this time, especially with technology introduced in 2005, we had front row seats. Between the tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, with the launch of Google Earth, Virtual Earth, and similar web sites, it became possible to have a different relationship to the destruction and the press photography. At the time of the tsunami, the press ran headlines like Spy satellites assessing tsunami damage. By the time of Katrina, we had become much more accustomed to the newer View from Above after only a few months of making it our own on the web. Tens of thousands of people checked on the conditions of their homes using Google Earth and overlaid photography. Many others used Google Maps or Virtual Earth. The story of how this affected the great Pakistan earthquakes only a month after Katrina is too complex to condense here, and it is not nearly over yet. People are still dying there as we write on the first day of 2006. Disasters now, and in the future, will be observed differently than in the past.\n",
      "line is: The year 2005 was also a time of war, not a twentieth-century loose lips sink ships kind of war, but a paranoia-ridden post-modern twenty-first-century war in which information spews as if from a firehose and is most difficult to control or comprehend. A number of countries are very uncomfortable with the world public's new-found ability to look in on their military facilities; and in the U.S., a fake letter from a soldier claiming that Google Earth was used as a kind of phildickian Eye in the Sky by our enemies to spy on U.S. troop positions was posted in over 300 places on the internet. (GE cannot be used in that way.) But as the year ended with a political scandal over \"domestic surveillance,\" it turns out that, yes, Americans are being spied on, but mostly by Americans. If 2005 was about something, it was about ways of seeing. And in a most literal sense it seems that here in the twenty-first century we begin to see things differently. We can see the world, and most of it is not like the home we are used to.\n",
      "line is: There is always a bit of an international surge in SF when the World SF convention is held outside the U.S., as it was in 2005 in Glasgow, Scotland. Certainly there was a commemorative anthology of original SF by Scots, Nova Scotia, from which we selected a couple of fine stories for this book. But more than that, the convention inspired small press publishers in the UK and Europe to produce books and magazines in time to show off at the convention, and there were a number of them. And there was an excellent anthology of new SF from the UK published without much fanfare, Constellations (DAW), edited by Peter Crowther, who was also the editor of Postscripts, the new UK quarterly magazine. Interzone, the flagship magazine of the UK, has a bright new look and a new editor. Of special interest was the reappearance of the Futures page in the scientific journal Nature, in spring 2005, a page devoted to a single short piece of SF every week for the rest of the year. So it appears that we can look forward to continued innovation in SF from the UK quarter, in particular, in the next few years.\n",
      "line is: It was also the year that SciFiction.com, the highest paying market for short fiction in SF & fantasy, was terminated. And at the end of the year, Infinite Matrix announced it was ceasing publication. So 2005 was perhaps the end of the first wave of the website magazines, leaving only Strange Horizons, a non-profit organization of the formerly top three fiction locations still intact. The electronic publishers on the internet maintained the levels of quality established a few years back, and remain an ambitious dimension of the SF field, but there was not a significant increase in the amount of good fiction originating on the internet. Perhaps we should be grateful for no decrease in 2005. It seems unlikely that a new magazine will arise soon on the internet to equal the pay and influence of SciFiction, but there are several that may be willing to try. Aeon, Revolution SF, Eidolon online, Fantastic Magnitude, and Challenging Destiny, for instance, show real promise.\n",
      "line is: We are still in the middle of some kind of short fiction boom in science fiction and the associated genres of the fantastic—we certainly hope not at the end. Not an economic boom—no one is getting paid much—but certainly a numbers increase, and it has been building for several years. The highest concentrations of excellence were still in the professional publications, the anthologies from the small press, and the highest paying online markets, though the small press zines were significant contributors too.\n",
      "line is: There are a lots of conclusions one might draw from this, but the one we highlight is that it makes this year's best volume even more useful, since we try to sort through all this material. But the small press really expanded again this past year, both in book form and in a proliferation of ambitious little magazines, in the U.S. and the rest of the world.\n",
      "line is: Each year we find ourselves pointing with some irony at the areas of growth in SF, as if they were double-edged swords. While many of the ambitious insiders want to break out, at least some ambitious outsiders are breaking in, and some of them at the top of the genre. This is now a trend several years old. Last year it was Karen Joy Fowler and then Kelly Link who made it firmly into the literary mainstream by continuing to do what they have always done, write excellently well. This year they really got noticed.\n",
      "line is: It is our opinion that it is a good thing to have genre boundaries. If we didn't, young writers would have to find something else, perhaps less interesting, to transgress or attack to draw attention to themselves.\n",
      "line is: We try in each volume of this series to represent the varieties of tones and voices and attitudes that keep the genre vigorous and responsive to the changing realities out of which it emerges, in science and daily life. It is supposed to be fun to read, a special kind of fun you cannot find elsewhere. This is a book about what's going on now in SF. The stories that follow show, and the story notes point out, the strengths of the evolving genre in the year 2005.\n",
      "line is: So we repeat, for readers new to this series, our usual disclaimer: This selection of science fiction stories represents the best that was published during the year 2005. It would take several more volumes this size to have nearly all of the best short stories—though even then, not all the best novellas. And we believe that representing the best from year to year, while it is not physically possible to encompass it all in one even very large book, also implies presenting some substantial variety of excellences, and we left some worthy stories out in order to include others in this limited space.\n",
      "line is: Our general principle for selection: This book is full of science fiction—every story in the book is clearly that and not something else. We have a high regard for horror, fantasy, speculative fiction, and slipstream, and postmodern literature. We (Kathryn Cramer and David G. Hartwell) edit the Year's Best Fantasy as well, a companion volume to this one—look for it if you enjoy short fantasy fiction, too. But here, we choose science fiction. You are invited.\n",

Something in Evan's gait seemed familiar, but then lately I had detected a bizarre habit of trying to associate every person I liked with Liam: If Jill made me laugh I listened to the tone of her voice to see if it was like Liam's when he told a story; if a guy on the street gave me a certain kind of smile I searched his face for Liam's thick eyebrows or his straight white teeth.\n",
      "line is: In the bedroom Kate was in her wheelchair, already dressed in a khaki skirt and blue T-shirt. Her damp hair left dark patches on the shoulders of her top. Her face was pale and bare, her eyes soft. Without makeup she seemed soft-fleshed, vulnerable as an open mollusk. When she spoke to me, her voice was low, the words slurred and indistinct though it was clear she was trying to enunciate. Evan translated after each phrase, switching pronouns and glancing back and forth between us.\n",

I'll learn soon enough, right?\" Maybe at the beginning she always gave herself a little grace period before she showed a total stranger everything. Frankly, I was grateful for the wait. I might not stay at this job beyond the summer. Perhaps I would never have to deal with dressing, period.\n",
      "line is: But I was resolved to put in the three months till September. Look at Jill—back in high school she'd stuck it out, for no money, volunteering at an ugly nursing home for almost a year. By contrast, I'd found a pretty easy deal (I allowed myself a moment of superiority), and presumably I had a bit more fortitude at twenty-one than Jill had had at seventeen.\n",

      "line is: I looked at my watch, and I told him. But whatever the dial on my wrist said, whatever minutes and hours I mentioned, I answered him wrongly.\n",
      "line is: It was 1984 when my life changed forever. May 1984. Duran Duran were at the top of the charts – and I was on top of the world. I was eighteen years old, living with two girlfriends in a shared house; a house where all our mates used to come to chill out, to watch movies or simply hang with a coffee and a nice slice of conversation. That day – that fateful day – the girls and I had headed from our hometown of Rugby to the big city: to Birmingham and its famous Bullring Shopping Centre. I'd been there the week before for the very first time, shopping with my mum for her birthday, and when I'd raved to my housemates about how amazing the shops were, we planned a girls' day out, just the three of us.\n",
      "line is: I was a short, skinny teenager then: a bubbly girl with distinctive bright red hair – and an even more distinctive quiff fringe, which I used to flick out of my eyes when I was dancing to Simon Le Bon in the nightclubs; dancing till my feet ached. I loved to dance – and to paint and to draw and to write. Music was in my soul – I sang everywhere. I loved anything that expressed myself.\n",
      "line is: I'd discovered writing when I was nine years old, after my father had died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of just thirty-eight. The only way I could express my crushing grief was through words. My English teacher, Mrs Mickleborough, told me I was a born writer; she said I'd moved her to tears with a poem I'd written about my father when I was ten. After that, she entered me into competitions for my poetry – competitions I won. I have continued to write poetry throughout my life, and I've included some of my poems in this book because they help to express what I was feeling, even in the darkest times. I also excelled in art. I drew all the time, anything from Beatrix Potter books for an old lady I knew to cartoons and my own artworks. The colours seeped into my dreams, and I hoped to make a career of it one day. Just one of my dreams.\n",
      "line is: Life at home was hard after my dad passed away. I won't go into it here, but let's just say I moved out as soon as I could, not long after my sixteenth birthday in November 1981, into a little bedsit. I worked like a demon to support myself. Even at home after school, when I was fifteen/sixteen, I was a waitress at a local hotel. Then when I left school, I worked in a newsagents/grocers, went on to selling windows and worked for an American health company. I then started in a bar in a working men's club, collecting glasses and doing other odd jobs as I was sixteen. At seventeen, I helped a woman run exercise classes; a good job for me, as I'd done gymnastics as a child and got into formation street-dancing as a teenager. It was another way of letting out any pain I had inside. You can't feel down, not when your feet are pounding in time to your own heartbeat, and your limbs are wild and free. I may have been on my own, but I was surviving. I was doing OK. I was doing the odd painted portrait for people too, putting my beloved art skills to good use.\n",
      "line is: Fashion was another one of my loves – especially clothes in bright colours, like those I swirled in my paint palettes – so this day at the Bullring was a real treat. The girls and I had only been living together for a few months at that time, and we really felt like a team as we browsed through the outfits on display, giggling over some of the more outlandish gear and oohing over other items. I had a sweet, kind boyfriend back then, a six-foot-four basketball player who also body-popped, and my brain was ticking over thoughts of what I might wear on our next night out clubbing together. I was fretting about our friendship a bit; I kept telling him he was too nice for me, that he deserved someone who wasn't quite so fragile inside, but he wouldn't listen. He was so nice he couldn't even see the damage in my heart.\n",
      "line is: It was on our second loop round the shops when it happened. We'd been shopping for a few hours by then, exploring most of the stores in the Bullring, so we were all flagging. We decided to sit and have a rest and a cuppa. It was a hot day and we were done in.\n",
      "line is: There was a café on the ground floor in an open area not far from where we were, so we headed for that. I strode across the mall towards the escalator in my sensible grey court shoes, my heels scoring a soundtrack to a scene I will never ever forget.\n",

      "line is: 'While it isn't ever something we would wish for, we would all nonetheless always prefer it to be the person beside us who dies, whether on a mission or in battle, in an air squadron or under bombardment or in the trenches when there were trenches, in a mugging or a raid on a shop or when a group of tourists is kidnapped, in an earthquake, an explosion, a terrorist attack, in a fire, it doesn't matter: even if it's our colleague, brother, father or even our child, however young. Or even the person we most love, yes, even them, anyone but us. Whenever someone covers another person with his own body, or places himself in the path of a bullet or a knife, these are all extraordinary exceptions, which is why they stand out, and most are fictitious and only appear in novels and films. The few real-life instances are the result of unthinking reflexes or else dictated by a strong sense of decorum of a sort that is becoming ever rarer, there are some who couldn't bear for a child or a loved one to pass into the next world with, as their final thought, the knowledge that a parent or lover had done nothing to prevent their death, had not sacrificed themselves, had not given their own life to save them, it's as if such people had internalized a hierarchy of the living, which seems so quaint and antiquated now, whereby children have more right to live than women and women more than men and men more than the old, or something of the sort, at least that's how it used to be, and such old-fashioned chivalry still persists in a dwindling band of people, those who still believe in that decorum, which, when you think about it, is quite absurd, after all, what do such final thoughts, such transient feelings of pique or disappointment matter when, a moment later, the person concerned will be dead and incapable of feeling either pique or disappointment, incapable, indeed, of thinking? It's true that there are still a few people who harbor this deep-seated belief and to whom it does matter, and they are, in fact, acting so that the person they are saving can bear witness, so that he or she will think well of them and remember them with eternal admiration and gratitude; what they don't realize at that decisive moment, or at least not fully, is that they will never enjoy that admiration or gratitude because they will be the ones who, a moment later, will be dead.'\n",
      "line is: And what came into my head while he was talking was an expression that was both difficult to grasp and possibly untranslatable, which is why, at first, I didn't mention it to Tupra, it would have taken me too long to explain. My initial thought was: 'It's what we call _\"vergüenza torera,\"_ literally \"a bullfighter's sense of shame,\"' and then: 'Because bullfighters, of course, have loads of witnesses, a whole arenaful, plus sometimes a TV audience of millions, so it's perfectly understandable that they should think: \"I'd rather leave here with a ruptured femoral artery or dead than be thought a coward in the presence of all these people who will go on to talk about it endlessly and forever.\" Bullfighters fear narrative horror like the plague, that final defining wrong move, they really care about how their lives end, it's the same with Dick Dearlove and almost any other public figure, I suppose, whose story is played out in full view of everyone at every stage or chapter, right up to the dénouement that can mark a whole life and give it an entirely false and unfair meaning.' And then I couldn't help saying it out loud, even though it meant briefly interrupting Tupra. But it did, after all, add to what he was saying and was also a way of pretending that this was a dialogue:\n",
      "line is: 'That's what we call _\"vergüenza torera.'\"_ And I said the two words in Spanish, then immediately translated them. 'I'll explain to you exactly what it means another day, since you don't have bullfighters here.' Although at that moment, I wasn't even sure there would be another day, another day at his side, not one.\n",
      "line is: 'OK, but don't forget. And no, you're right, we don't have bullfighters here.' Tupra was always curious to hear the turns of phrase in my own language about which I occasionally enlightened him, whenever they seemed relevant or were particularly striking. Now, however, he was enlightening me (I knew where he was heading, and both he and the path he was taking aroused my curiosity over and above the foreseeable revulsion I would feel at the end of the journey), and so he continued: 'From there to letting someone die in order to save yourself is only a step, and trying to ensure that someone else dies in your place or even bringing that about (you know the kind of thing, it's him or me) is just one more short step, and both steps are easily taken, especially the first, in fact, in an extreme situation, almost everyone takes that step. How else explain why it is that in a fire at a theater or a disco more people are crushed or trampled to death than burned or asphyxiated, or why when a ship sinks there are people who don't even wait for the lifeboat to be full before lowering it into the water, just so that they can get away quickly and without being burdened by other passengers, or why the expression \"Every man for himself\" exists, which, after all, means discarding all consideration for others and reverting to the law of the jungle, which we all accept and to which we return without a second's thought, even though we've spent more than half our lives with that law in abeyance or under control. The reality is that we're doing violence to ourselves by not following and obeying it at all times and in all circumstances, but even so we apply that law far more often than we acknowledge, but surreptitiously, under cover of a thin veneer of civility or in the guise of other more respectful laws and regulations, more slowly and with numerous detours and stages along the way, it's all very laborious but, deep down, it's the law of the jungle that rules, that holds sway. It is, think about it. Among individuals and among nations.'\n",
      "line is: Tupra had used the English equivalent of _'Sálvese quien pueda,'_ which means literally 'Save yourself if you can,' whereas 'Every man for himself' denotes perhaps even fewer scruples: let each man save his own skin and worry only about himself, save himself by whatever means are available to him, and let others look after themselves, the weaker, the slower, the more ingenuous and the more stupid (and the more protective, too, like my son Guillermo). At that moment, you can allow yourself to shove and trample and kick others out of the way, or use an oar to smash in the head of anyone trying to hold onto your boat and get into it when it's already sliding down into the water with you and yours inside it, and there's no room for anyone else, or you simply don't want to share it or run the risk of capsizing. The situations may be different, but that commanding voice belongs to the same family or type as three other voices: the voice that issues an instruction to fire at will, to slaughter, to beat a disorderly retreat or to flee en masse; the one that orders to shoot at close range and indiscriminately whoever you happen to see or catch, the voice urging us to bayonet or knife someone, to take no prisoners, to leave not a soul alive ('Give no quarter,' is the command, or worse 'Show no mercy'); and the voice that tells us to fly, to withdraw and break ranks, _pêle-mêle_ in French or _pell mell_ in its English form; soldiers fleeing en masse when there are not enough escape routes to flee alone, each listening only to his own survival instinct and therefore indifferent to the fate of his companions, who no longer count and who have, in fact, ceased to be companions, even though we're all still in uniform and feel, more or less, the same fear in that shared flight.\n",
      "line is: I sat looking at Tupra in the light of the lamps and in the light of the fire, the latter making his complexion more coppery than usual, as if he had Native American blood in his veins—it occurred to me then that his lips could perhaps be Sioux—his complexion now not so much the color of beer as of whisky. He had not yet reached his destination, he had only begun his journey and would not be slow about it, and I was sure that sooner or later he would ask me that question again: 'Why can't one do that? Why can't one, according to you, go around beating people up and killing them?' And I still had no answers that would convince him, I had to keep thinking about something we never do think about because we take it as universally agreed, as immutable and normal and right. The answers going round in my head were fine for the majority, so much so that anyone could have given them, but not for Reresby, if he still was Reresby or perhaps he never ceased being him and was always all of them, simultaneously, Ure and Dundas and Reresby and Tupra, and who knows how many other names in the course of his turbulent life in all those different places, although now he did seem to have settled down. Doubtless his names were legion and he wouldn't be able to remember every last one or, indeed, every first one, people who accumulate many experiences tend to forget what they did at a particular time or at various times. There's not a trace in them of who they were then, and it's as if they had never been.\n",
      "line is: 'But in those situations, there are always people willing to lend a hand,' I murmured feebly. 'People willing to help someone else into the boat or risk their own life by rescuing someone from the flames. Not everyone flees in terror or runs for cover. Not everyone simply abandons strangers to their fate.'\n",
      "line is: And my eyes remained fixed on the flames. When we'd arrived, there had still been the embers of a fire in the grate, and it had taken Tupra little effort to revive it, doubtless because he enjoyed an open fire or else to save on heating, which, I noticed, was turned down low—a lot of English people, even the filthy rich, like to economize on such things. This meant either that he must have servants or else didn't live alone, there in his three-storey house which was, as I'd speculated, in Hampstead, a very plush area, a place for the wealthy, perhaps he earned much more than I imagined (not that I'd given it much thought), he was, after all, only a functionary, however high up he was in the hierarchy, and I didn't think he was particularly high up. So perhaps it wasn't his house, but Beryl's and he was there thanks to their as yet unannulled marriage, or more likely thanks to his first marriage and to an advantageous divorce settlement, Wheeler had told me that Tupra had been married twice and that Beryl was considering trying to win him back because, since their separation, her life had signally failed to improve. Or perhaps Tupra enjoyed other sources of income apart from that of his known profession, or perhaps the extras that this brought him ('the frequent pleasant surprises, paid in kind,' as Peter put it) far exceeded my imaginative capabilities. It seemed to me improbable that he would have inherited such a house from the first British Tupra or, indeed, from the second, one or the other must have been immigrants from some low-ranking country. Although who knows, perhaps his grandfather or father had been quick off the mark and swiftly amassed a fortune, anything's possible, by dirty dealings or through usury or banking, it comes to the same thing, such fortunes appear in a flash, like lightning, but with one difference, they persist and grow, or perhaps those first Tupras had married into money, unlikely, unless they already possessed the gift of making themselves irresistible to women and that gift was the legacy they bequeathed to Tupra, their descendant.\n",
      "line is: We were in a large sitting room, which was clearly not the only one in the house (I'd glimpsed another from the corridor, unless it was just a billiards room, for it contained a green baize table), well furnished, well carpeted, with very expensive bookshelves (something I do know about) and on them some very fine and costly books (I can tell that, too, from afar, at a single glance), and I spotted on the walls what was certainly a Stubbs equine portrait and what looked to me like a Jean Béraud, a large-scale work depicting some elegant casino of the time, at Baden-Baden or Monte Carlo, and a possible De Nittis of rather more modest dimensions (I know about paintings as well), society people in a park with thoroughbreds in the background, and none of these pictures, it seemed to me, were copies. Someone in that house knew or had known a thing or two about art, someone keen on horse-racing or on betting in general, and my host, of course, was keen on the former, as he was on soccer or at least on the Chelsea Blues. To acquire such works one doesn't necessarily have to be a pound or euro multimillionaire, but you do need either to have some surplus cash or to be absolutely sure that more money will be forthcoming after each extravagance. The place felt more like the home of a well-to-do diplomat or some eminent professor who doesn't depend on his salary—the kind who works not so much to earn a living as to gain recognition—than the home of an army employee appointed to carry out certain obscure and indefinable civilian tasks, I couldn't forget that the initials MI6 and MI5 meant Military Intelligence; and then it occurred to me that Tupra might be a high-ranking officer, a Colonel, a Major or perhaps the Commander of a frigate, like Ian Fleming and his character James Bond, especially if he was from the Navy, from the former OIC, the Operational Intelligence Centre, which, according to Wheeler, had provided the best men, or from the NID, the Naval Intelligence Division, of which it was part. I was gradually reading and learning about the organization and distribution of these services from the books that Tupra kept in his office and which I sometimes leafed through when I was alone, working late at the building with no name, or arrived early to start or to finish some report, and when I might find the young Pérez Nuix drying her bare torso with a towel because she'd spent the night there, or so she said.\n",
      "line is: I fixed my weary eyes on the fire that Reresby had lit and which contributed in no small part to transforming his sitting room into a story-book setting, a place of enchantment, and there came into my mind the image of a more welcoming and, in fact, unusual, but, how I can put it, not entirely non-existent London, the London of Wendy's parents in the Disney version of _Peter Pan_ , with its square windowpanes framed by strips of white lacquered wood and its equally white bookshelves, its clusters of chimneys and its peaceful attic rooms, at least that's how I recalled the home I had seen in the dark in my childhood, cartoons so comforting that one wanted to live in them. Yes, Tupra's house was cosy and comfortable, the kind of house that helps you to forget about things and relax, it also had something about it of the house inhabited by Professor Higgins, as played by Rex Harrison in _My Fair Lady_ , although his was in Marylebone and Wendy's in Bloomsbury, I think, and Tupra's was there in Hampstead, further to the north. Perhaps he needed these benign, tranquil surroundings in order to cancel out and isolate himself from his many intersecting, murky and even violent activities, perhaps his background as a low-born foreigner or his origins in Bethnal Green or in some other depressing area had made him aspire to a mode of decor so opposed to the sordid that it's almost only ever found in fiction, intended for children if they're by Barrie or for adults if they're by Dickens, he was bound to have seen that film based on the work of the former, the dramatist, when it came out, as did every child in our day in any country in this world of ours, I'd seen it dozens of times in my own childhood world.\n",
      "line is: He took out one of his Egyptian cigarettes and offered it to me, he was my host now and was mechanically aware of that, he'd also offered me a drink which, for the moment, I'd declined, he'd poured himself a port not from an ordinary bottle, but from one with a little medal about its neck, like those passed swiftly round in a clockwise direction by the guests (there were always several bottles, they never stopped coming) during the dessert course at the high tables to which I was occasionally invited by colleagues in my distant Oxford days, perhaps _his_ Oxford colleagues still sent him some of that extraordinary port wine from the college cellars and which one can find nowhere else. I hadn't kept up with how much Tupra had drunk during that long, interminable evening which had still not yet ended, although he had, I imagined, drunk no less than I had, and I didn't want and couldn't hold another drop, he, however, seemed unaffected by the alcohol or else its ravages were not apparent. The quantity of alcohol consumed, however, had had nothing to do with his terrorizing and punishing or beating or thrashing of De la Garza, for he had behaved throughout with precision and calculation. Who knows, though, perhaps it _had_ influenced his decision to demonstrate to De la Garza his variant—varying—modes of death and to leave both De la Garza and me alive so that we would always remember them, it's rare for the resolve to do something and the actual execution of that act to coincide, even though the two things may follow on and appear to be simultaneous, perhaps he'd taken that decision when his head was still fuzzy, still hot, and his head had cleared and cooled during the few minutes I'd spent waiting for him in the handicapped toilet along with our trusting victim, for I'd tricked De la Garza into going there with the false promise of a line of cocaine, although I didn't know at the time why I was putting him, the victim, where I'd been asked to put him or that the promise was a mere pretext. I should have imagined it, I should have foreseen it. I should have refused to have anything to do with it. I'd prepared him for Tupra, served him up on a plate, I had, in the end, been a part of it all. I was about to ask him, out of curiosity: 'Was it real cocaine you gave the poor devil?' But, as often happens after long silences, we both spoke at once and he got in just a fraction of a second before me, in order to reply to the last thing I'd said:\n",

Plus, I'm beginning to think there's nothing wrong with corny. It's okay to tell the doorman to have a good day when he opens the door for you in the morning on the way to school. And why not stop to smell the lilacs planted outside the apartment buildings along Fifth Avenue? While you're at it, go ahead and stick a bunch behind your ear. It's still only April, but you now have permission to wear those new mint green leather Coach flip-flops—you know, the ones with the little yellow roses embroidered on them that you've been wearing around the house for over a month?— _outside_.

From now on we'll be branded by the school we choose, or rather, the school that chooses us: the smarty-pants who got into Yale, the lesbionic B-student volleyball player bound for Smith, the flaky heiress whose dad bought her into Brown.

      "line is: \"I must be drunker than I thought,\" the duke said, dabbing his chin. \"For I could have sworn the Earl of Boden just asked me to find him a wife. And if that wasn't strange enough, the aforementioned earl is supposed to be in Liverpool turning everything he touches into gold. He couldn't possibly be in a London ballroom, certainly not without letting me know he was back in town first.\" Worth sounded affronted, though he was grinning as he said the last.\n",

      "line is: One can notice a prominent scar on Swami Ramdev's forehead. This injury was not an ordinary one but it was so grave that the world could've lost his prodigious talent in his childhood itself.\n",
      "line is: Ramkishan's mother, Gulab Devi says, \"Ramkishan was only six years old. He was playing on the terrace with his sister. While playing, his leg slipped and he fell on his head in the courtyard of the house. He was rushed to the closest hospital where the doctor said that he had lost a lot of blood and little more delay would've caused the child to either go into coma or could have even lost his life. We thought we lost him but he was safe and sound by God's grace.\"\n",
      "line is: Today's Swami Ramdev was his parents' beloved Ramkishan in his childhood. He learnt to fight and defeat death right after his birth. It had not been very long since his birth that infant Ramkishan's face was struck by a paralytic attack. It was indeed a destructive attack but destiny did not approve of it. Destiny had rather sent him in this world to be the epicenter of a yoga revolution in form of Swami Ramdev and that's why, infant Ramkishan survived that paralytic attack but it was so consequential that a slight effect of it can still be seen on Swami Ramdev's face.\n",
      "line is: Death continued to play hide and seek with little Ramkishan. He was only seven or eight years old when he and death stood face to face once again. His mother Gulab Devi tells, \"Ramkishan had gone to the pond with his friends. Suddenly he went into the deep waters and got drowned. His friends started shouting for help. On hearing their voices, one of the village men jumped into the water and saved him. He was not conscious as a lot of water had rushed into his stomach. God blessed my son once again and he regained consciousness. After this, we were so scared to lose him that even few moments of his absence would make us restless.\"\n",
      "line is: According to mother Gulab Devi, Having faced death twice till the age of eight years, Ramkishan stayed aloof and mostly distracted. There were portraits of freedom fighters like Chandra Shekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh, Ram Prasad Bismil etc. in our house. Ramkishan stared at them for hours and he would not say anything even if we asked him something. One fine day, he said, \"Mother, I will also be a revolutionist like them when I grow up.\" I smiled and said, \"Yes son, you will also bring a revolution... Little did I know that he will ultimately prove my words right.\" Pictures of patriots and mother's light words ignited such a determination in the eight-years-old Ramkishan that he grew up to be a major name in the world of changing systems.\n",
      "line is: Swami Ramdev was born in a small village called Said Alipur in the Mahendraghar district of Haryana. According to the Indian ascetic convention, a hermit is believed to be born in another life after renouncing the world, thereby ending the relevance of the previous life. Swami Ramdev has erased his birth date from his life. He does not discuss his factual birthday ever, nor is it celebrated in the institution. Moreover, his parents also don't remember his birth date. Even on asking again and again, Swami Ramdev only smiles and says that he was born only after he accepted asceticism, hence it would be appropriate to say that his birth date is 9 April 1995, the day when his guru, Acharya Shankardev ordained asceticism to him. Though the web world presents a date as Swami Ramdev's birthday, it is not credible at all. Swami Ramdev says, \"How can we trust the world of internet? Any date has been put up as my birthday, but if the truth be told, I have totally scraped it out of my life, hence the discussion over that date holds no ground.\"\n",
      "line is: Baba Ramdev was born in the Yadav clan of Yogeshwar Shrikrishna and his childhood name was Ramkishan. Ramkishan's mother's name is Shreemati Gulab Devi and his father's name is Shree Ramniwas Yadav. Ramniwas and Gulab Devi had three sons and one daughter and Ramkishan was their second child. All the siblings grew in an ambiance of love and affection and shared a caring and warm relationship.\n",
      "line is: Ramkishan's father, Ramniwas was an ordinary farmer. Ramkishan's mother, Gulab Devi was a very religious woman. She never tried to rationalise anything related to God and religion and accepted everything as God's will. She had an unshakable faith in God. While Ramkishan was in his mother's womb, she always felt that this child was different. She felt divinity in her womb but she couldn't understand this due to her nescience. After Ramkishan's metamorphosis into Swami Ramdev, she told him that she always felt he was special, even when he was in her womb. 18 years after Ramkishan left the house, his mother told him that she always knew that this child will not only cure her sufferings but will free the world from the chains of ailments. She developed such a belief because of the feeling of blessedness that her unborn baby gave her. Ramkishan's mother was healthy and happy. Her face glowed, and she felt peaceful and calm while he was in her womb. Usually would-be mothers face a lot of problems during their pregnancy but for all the nine months when Ramkishan was in his mother's womb, she was ecstatic and in the pink of her health. When Ramkishan reached his cradle after his birth, he was quiet, and it seemed as if that infant had streams of calmness flowing within him. Neither would he cry when hungry nor would he get excited to be in someone's lap like other children would. Seeing this, as a mother, Gulab Devi would become speculative, she would hold him close and pamper him but he would look at her like a devotee, without a blink and he would affectionately touch her face with his tiny fingers.\n",
      "line is: His mother Gulab Devi says, \"When Ramkishan grew up, he was not at all like other children of his age. Unlike others, he would stay alone and silent. There was slight stubbornness in him, he would do what he wanted to do and no one could convince him to do otherwise. And no one ever understood what made him say that he wanted to be a hermit when he grows up. We never took this seriously, but we hardly knew that something that was merely a joke for us, will ultimately be the lifestyle of his choice.\"\n",
      "line is: Ramkishan was very content as a child; he was never dissatisfied with anything in his life. His mother says, \"I can't recall if Ramkishan ever had a materialistic demand. He never got tempted to anything else but his only willfulness was towards becoming a hermit.\"\n",
      "line is: Gulab Devi tries to recall and tells us, \"Ramkishan was probably in the 6th standard when he was strongly drawn towards ascetics.\" Agreeing with this, Swami Ramdev says, \"I was attracted towards renunciation in the 6th standard; there were waves of determination to embrace this life, and I realised that I had to leave my house and go as I started to believe that I was not meant for the family life. I knew my purpose was different.\"\n",

It was of her wedding day in April 1975, nine years earlier. Annie and William were standing together outside the church with his colleagues from the South Yorkshire police forming a guard of honour behind. William looked grand in his formal police regalia. Beside him stood his best man, Paul Fleming, smiling broadly. Annie, on William's other side, looked young and anxious, clutching her flowers.\n",

With so many siblings between us, growing up, it was easy to feel as though the two of us existed in the same solar system but never visited each other's planets. After all, Delorse was heading off to college as I was entering kindergarten. I have vague childhood memories of her—Delorse cornrowing my hair way too tightly, giving me a braid headache; Delorse teaching my older brothers and sisters how to do a brand-new dance called The Bump; Delorse walking down the aisle at her wedding, my sister Sandie and me behind her holding up the train of her gown, our father at her side. As a child, she was the role model of the kind of woman I was supposed to grow up to be. As an adult, she's one of my best friends. Most of the important memories of my grown-up life include her. So I suppose it is fitting that she is here now, muttering these words at me.

      "line is: Usually people cried when they came here for the first time, and this girl looked as if she'd be no exception. She walked in with a briefcase and a swagger and shook Grace's hand like the cool professional she clearly was, or at least wished to be. Then she sat on the couch and crossed one long twill-encased leg over the other. And _then_ , sort of abruptly, she seemed to register where she was, with a wallop.\n",
      "line is: \"Oh wow,\" said the girl, whose name—Grace had double-checked a few minutes earlier—was Rebecca Wynne. \"I haven't been in a therapist's office since college.\"\n",
      "line is: Grace sat in her customary chair, crossed her own much shorter legs, and leaned forward. She couldn't help it.\n",
      "line is: \"It's so bizarre! The minute you come in here, you just want to start bawling.\"\n",
      "line is: \"Plenty of Kleenex.\" Grace smiled. How many times had she sat in this chair, with her legs crossed just the way they were now, listening to the room fill up with weeping. Weeping happened here so often, she sometimes imagined her office underwater, as in one of the magical Betty MacDonald stories she'd loved as a child, where the crybaby protagonist literally couldn't stop sobbing until the water had risen to her chin. When there was extreme anger, the shouting kind or the silent, venomous kind, she envisioned the walls of her office (in actuality painted a very innocuous off-white) turning dark with rage. When there was happiness or accord, she sometimes imagined she could smell sweet pine, as from late summer at the lake.\n",
      "line is: \"Well, it's just a room,\" she said cheerily. \"With boring furniture.\"\n",
      "line is: \"Right.\" Rebecca looked around, as if this needed confirmation. The room—Grace's consulting room—had been constructed with immense care to be many things at once: comfortable but not particularly inviting, warm without troubling individuality, decorated with things so familiar they commonly resonated: that Eliot Porter print of the birches she had up beside the door—hadn't everyone lived with that poster at some point? dorm room? summer rental?—the red kilim rug, the oatmeal-colored couch, and her own swiveling leather chair. There was a glass-topped coffee table with a single box of Kleenex in a leather holder and an old country pine desk in the corner, its drawers stocked with yellow legal pads and lists of psychopharmacologists, child psychologists, smoking-cessation hypnotherapists, real estate agents, travel agents, mediators, estate planners, divorce attorneys. On the desktop, pens protruded from an unlovely ceramic mug her son, Henry, had made in first grade (this was an item that had, over the years, elicited an astonishing number of comments, ushered into speech a remarkable number of impacted memories), and a white ceramic lamp with a burlap shade threw discreet light on the proceedings. The only window overlooked the back alley of the building, and there was never anything out there to see, despite one attempt years earlier to install a planter of some bright no-brainer flora—geraniums, actually, and ivy. The superintendent had signed off on this project, though his enthusiasm stopped well short of helping her maneuver the wooden planter off its truck and down the alley to its resting spot, but the plants had starved for light and the planter itself disappeared soon after, leaving a dark mark on the cement that persisted. She was not a flower person, really.\n",
      "line is: Today, though, she had actually brought in flowers: dark pink roses, on the specific recommendation of Sarabeth, who—as the Great Day drew ever nearer—was becoming more and more inclined to micromanage. Not only must Grace purchase flowers for this occasion, but they must be roses, and the roses must be pink— _dark_ pink.\n",
      "line is: Dark pink roses. _Why?_ Grace had wondered. Sarabeth wasn't expecting a color photograph, was she? Was it not sufficiently incredible that _Vogue_ magazine had a black-and-white picture's worth of interest in her? But she'd done as she was told, plunking them in the only vase she had in the office's little galley kitchen, from a forgotten flower delivery (end-of-treatment flowers? thank-you-for-showing-me-I-had-to-leave-him flowers? Jonathan flowers?), awkwardly and not very prettily spreading them out. Now they sat on one of the end tables, in some danger of being overturned by Rebecca's heavy wool coat.\n",
      "line is: \"You know,\" Grace said, \"you're right about the crying. Usually it takes a lot out of people just to get here. Or in the case of my practice, to get their partner here. It's very common to see people just let go when they finally make it through the door for the first time. It's perfectly all right.\"\n",
      "line is: \"Well, another time, perhaps,\" the girl said. She was thirty, Grace thought, give or take, and pretty, if a bit severe, and the clothes she wore had been rather cleverly designed to conceal her actual body type, which was plainly curvaceous and buxom, and present in its place the fiction that she was boyish and lean. The white cotton shirt looked as if it had been tailored expressly for this purpose, and the brown twill pants hit at exactly the right spot to suggest a waist that was barely there. Both pieces were triumphs of illusion and had clearly been made by someone who knew exactly what they were doing—but when one worked for _Vogue_ , Grace imagined, one had access to such people.\n",

If I were persuaded of that, I would have headed long ago for the nearest _babalawo_ for the rites of exorcism! I am, contrary to all legitimately cited evidence—and none more damning than the accused's own history—actually a closet glutton for tranquillity. An oft-quoted remark of mine—\"Justice is the first condition of humanity\"—does, however, act constantly against the fulfillment of that craving for peace, an insertion into my mental template that can be regarded as a \"categorical imperative.\" There is nothing mystical about it, nothing beyond an overacute, remedial sense of right and wrong, of what is just and unjust.\n",
      "line is: A casual involvement, at a most impressionable age, with the Abeokuta women's movement, narrated in _Aké,_ may have prepared the soil. That began in the late 1930s, when the women, led by my aunt, the formidable Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, rose against unjust taxes and chased the feudal lord, the Alake of Abeokuta, from his throne. So might also the induction, in my school days, into the propensities of the class bully, merging onto a broader canvas of the arrogant ways of colonial domination. That last in turn formed a continuum of visceral identification with the apartheid victims of South Africa, a condition that ironically honed itself to an insurgent pitch only when I arrived in the United Kingdom in 1954, into the homeland of a colonial power that ruled with violence in parts of Asia and Africa, Kenya most notoriously on the latter continent.\n",
      "line is: When I was studying in England in the mid-1950s, vacations found most of us African students headed for London from all over the British Isles to earn some extra money—mostly as porters in railway stations and post offices. We would then gather at the Overseas Students Club in Earl's Court, the University of London Student Union, or the West African Students Union in Porchester Terrace, Bayswater. There, virtually only one topic dominated all conversation: colonization and how/when to end it! The West African colonies appeared to be on their way to negotiated independence, so our agitated sights were set in other directions. Kenya was embroiled in the Mau Mau revolt, a truly indigenous, internally generated struggle, in which the forests favored the liberation fighters. South Africa, however, occupied a special place of bafflement, rage, and despair. Awareness of that degraded zone of existence on the soil of our own continent, the apprehension of a world that assigned to one's race a condition of subhumanity, was all-consuming. We began to prepare ourselves for the day when we would reclaim that humanity—by force of arms if needed.\n",
      "line is: This obsession with the humiliation of racist entrenchment in southern Africa was not one of bloodless empathy—we did, after all, savor mild doses of that condition in our encounters with the white natives on their own territory. Even as a student, occupying a mostly sheltered environment, I did not escape pointed acts of contempt or rejection. My overanthologized poem \"Telephone Conversation,\" the record of an exchange with a landlady, was only one of my many trite encounters with British racism. On public transport, for instance— although admittedly I _enjoyed_ having a seat to myself in a filled-up double-decker bus, which made turning over the abnormally broad pages of _The_ _Yorkshire Post_ much easier—could I really pretend not to notice, or fail to be stung by, the fact that a boarding passenger had traversed the length of the bus, seen the one empty seat next to me, but had chosen to retrace his or her steps and climb upstairs to search for a vacant seat? That the same passenger had come down again—no standing allowed upstairs—and chosen to attach his or her arm to a strap sooner than take that empty seat? Or, even more blatantly, when I was about to take the nearest vacant seat on a two-seat bench, that the occupant next to the window would shoot up, quickly extricate his or her body, and move to another seat or remain standing? Incidents like these, even in the mid-1950s, were mind-numbingly commonplace.\n",
      "line is: In shops, you turned invisible. The shopkeeper ostentatiously pretended not to see you and turned to attend to someone who had entered the shop long after you. He was quick with the apology and excuses, of course, the moment you shouted a belligerent \"Excuse me!\" Then followed the predictable \"Oh, so sorry, were you next?\" with an oiled, hypocritical voice the worse for being in a thick regional accent, when—irrationally—you somehow expected the country yokels to be more human than their cosmopolitan sophisticates.\n",
      "line is: How did one cope? Sometimes by invoking the inner confidence of one's mental superiority—that was easy enough; many of the natives were ignorant of much that was routine knowledge to any student. For a start, they did not even know where on the globe Africa is located. More to the point, in our own colonized territories, a white man was always associated with lordly positions of authority, yet here they were, finally exposed in all their grime and sweat, workers and peasants like our own mortal beings, often more wretched and impoverished than the poorest menial at home! Corporeally, all our student nostrils were in complete agreement that white people—almost uniformly— stank! They gave off a most upsetting odor, only slightly less upsetting than the belated discovery that they actually thought that we also stank! On balance, it was impossible to make an issue of racial slights all the time, and the more politicized of us, faced with a racial affront, simply switched our minds to that distant bastion of racism itself, apartheid South Africa: _You wait!_ —an inward, vengeful mutter— _You are not remotely close to the league of your apartheid_ kin. When we have wiped out that main reservoir of racial disdain, these poisoned _outposts of the same a fliction will simply wither away, atrophied from lack of further nourishment from the ultimate exemplar._\n",
      "line is: Writing poems such as \"Telephone Conversation\"—together with the satisfaction of reading it over _their own_ radio station, the BBC—also helped. So did attempts to write for theater. A full-length play over which I labored for months had a Boer family trapped in their farmstead, where they were slowly eaten by black soldier ants—I rode the horses of vengeful symbolism to their knees! A lecturer commented that the play was long on purple passages. I was encountering that phrase for the first time but instantly understood what he meant and promptly added it to my vocabulary of self-censorship. The play also owed far too much to Eugene O'Neill, whose works I was studying at the time, so after reams of sheets trying and failing to expunge all further borrowings, I committed the first auto-da-fé of my career and set the play on fire.\n",
      "line is: A shorter play, _The Invention,_ was produced as one of the Royal Court Theatre's Sunday-night experiments in December 1959. It climaxed in an explosion that wiped out a group of white scientists who had been researching the accurate determination of racial types in South Africa—so much for wish fulfillment by the theatrical route! To make matters worse—a cautionary portent for our future plans, perhaps?—the explosion refused to occur on cue!\n",
      "line is: Offstage, we followed the descent of South Africa into a solidifying black negation. By 1955, the nation's apartheid stucture was cemented by the Nationalist government, uprooting the black population from proximity to white estates—except under license as daytime servants and menials—and resettling them in the so-called townships, more accurately described by another name: shantytowns. In our projections, this pointed to only one conclusion: at the first sign of uprising by the black population, those shantytowns would be surgically taken out, bombed out of existence with no danger whatever to the white population! It was that stark, that logical. An internal war of liberation, in the manner of Kenya's Mau Mau, appeared to have been rendered impracticable, literally overnight. As a counterinsurgency action in the preventive mode, the Boers' move was a masterstroke.\n",
      "line is: We knew our history, however. The Spanish Civil War had given birth to a volunteer international force, of which the writers and artists units, such as the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, played courageous but mostly tragic roles. As we argued and constructed possible scenarios at the student clubs, buoyed by tea and biscuits, lager-and-lime and cider, sandwiches and sausage rolls, warmed by the glow of the fireplace after a hard day's work delivering Christmas parcels or lugging railway baggage, our conclusions pointed us in a similar direction— to prepare ourselves for the liberation war in South Africa. We saw that ill-used tip of the continent being restored to the black race by a Continental Brigade of volunteers converging on the South from every corner of the black landmass. It was the most obvious solution. That future was so clear to us—our generation could not escape the destiny of marching down to terminate the racial insult that rebuked our very being as black peoples. Whenever I had cause to think of that prospect, I confess that I felt nothing but a warm glow of anticipation. It made personal encounters with racial prejudice easy to ignore— I _knew_ something that my local tormentors did not!\n",
      "line is: We knew, beyond all doubt, our place within the evolving organism of new nations. We, the young generation of that independence phase, were a renaissance people who would transform the strange bequest into a world marvel. The only way to grasp this confidence, this self-assurance, was to treat it as _pure knowledge._ Not intuition, not revelation, not blind faith, not ambition, not deductive reasoning or a conscious sense of mission—no, simply as _knowledge_ in its purest, unassailable form! We _were_ the renaissance people! And we were working in our various fields—quite indifferent to any special designation— to bring about this renaissance.\n",

Nestled on the front of Lake Sammamish, my destination was a sprawling behemoth of a house—like many in the greater Seattle metropolitan area, jokingly referred to as _McMansions_. Cookie-cutter design like its neighbors, the monster was a tribute to the high wages and high cost of living that came with this area.\n",

      "line is: Behind me, in a sheer flowing robe that mirrored the twilight sky, stood Greta, my mentor, the leader of the Death Maidens. Petite, with hair the color of burnished copper, Greta and I bore the same tattoos, only hers were far older and more brilliant.\n",
      "line is: Emblazoned on our foreheads were onyx crescents, hers burning with a vivid flame. Mine sparkled a glistening black most of the time. An intricate lacework of black and orange leaves wound up our forearms. Hers were vivid. Mine had started as a pale shadow but now were nearing a similar intensity.\n",
      "line is: Patiently standing a few steps behind me, Greta waited as I contemplated the house. I was dressed in a flowing robe similar to hers, though mine wasn't sheer. I absently toyed with the tasseled belt girding my waist as I gauged the timing. This would be my fifth kill in the past month—or _oblition_ , as it was called in Haseofon—and this time, I was on my own. Greta was merely supervising.\n",
      "line is: I'd been on a fast track the past eight weeks, spending a lot of time in Haseofon, the temple of the Death Maidens, learning to fight on the astral where we worked. And I'd been taking a high dose of the _panteris phir_ , or Panther's Fang, to gain better control over my shifting into the black panther side of myself.\n",
      "line is: I was surprised the latter had been working so well, considering how little control I still had over shifting into my Tabby self. Greta told me that since Panther was a gift from the Autumn Lord rather than something I was born with, my half-human heritage wasn't a stumbling block to controlling the ability.\n",

The gentle chiming of a clock as it counted down the last moments of Gerald Hanson's life. The clock—or sensor—was my guide, urging me on, directing me when to move in, at what precise moment to grapple with Gerald's soul and send it spinning into oblivion.\n",
      "line is: The only thing I knew about Gerald at this moment was that he was a lawyer, and his life was forfeit to keep the balance. Grandmother Coyote had called in a favor from the Autumn Lord, and Hi'ran had specifically directed that _I_ be the one to take care of this. For whatever reason, I was to be the Death Maiden who attended his departure.\n",

      "line is: Be it a TV biopic, a greatest-hits repackaging, a tribute album, or a string of documentaries, something comes along from time to time that fuels a resurgence of interest in the lives and music of Karen and Richard Carpenter. Whatever the catalyst for revival, it's nice to see their classic recordings celebrated by nostalgia buffs. But it is especially pleasing to see them shared with new generations of ardent music lovers. A new wave of appreciation surfaced in 2010 with the release of my book _Little Girl Blue: The Life of Karen Carpenter._ Not only did this new biography spark the curiosity of faithful diehards, but it brought a number of dormant admirers out of the woodwork.\n",
      "line is: As the author of _Little Girl Blue,_ I have recently had the pleasure of meeting Carpenters enthusiasts—young and old—across the country at various book-related events. Some recall having \"We've Only Just Begun\" in their wedding. Others have fond memories of attending a Carpenters concert as adolescents. Longtime fans are dusting off their old Carpenters LPs, and new devotees are cranking playlists of the duo's hits on their iPods. The letters, e-mails, and interview requests I receive have no apparent geographic constraints. No matter the story, the sentiment is the same—fans share a warmth and affection for the Carpenters and their recordings. The music is timeless; its appeal universal.\n",
      "line is: More than a decade ago, I compiled and edited what was (and still is) the first Carpenters book of its kind: _Yesterday Once More._ Well, it's back again, just like a long-lost friend. But this time, it's revised and expanded—a history book of sorts, in the making for more than forty years.\n",
      "line is: Featuring the thoughts and words of journalists and critics, as well as Karen and Richard themselves, this collection holds more than fifty articles, essays, interviews, press releases, and reviews. The Carpenters are well suited to this pointillism-style biography. Their happiness and heartbreak, their triumphs and tragedies, were all recorded on the pages of magazines and newspapers all around the world.\n",
      "line is: Varying perspectives and opinions on the group were intentionally included to convey a sense of how the Carpenters were viewed during their heyday—and how they have been continually rediscovered in the years since Karen's untimely death in 1983. Through the years, the Carpenters had cynics questioning (and even occasionally attacking) them, but they had some eloquent defenders, too. Writers such as Tom Nolan, Ray Coleman, John Tobler, and Robert Hilburn explore the artistry of the Carpenters in critical assessments. Scholarly essays from music authorities, such as Frank Pooler and Daniel Levitin, analyze the technical elements of the group's innovative vocal and instrumental arrangements. Extensive interviews with Karen and Richard provide the duo's own assessment of their music, their goals, and their image. Reviews from _Variety_ and other sources trace the Carpenters' concerts from their early Vegas shows to their concert-hall triumphs, such as their 1976 London Palladium engagement, and all the way through to some of Richard's more recent solo performances.\n",
      "line is: In addition to analyses from respected music-industry publications such as _Billboard, Blender, Rolling Stone,_ and _Melody Maker,_ this book includes some rather lightweight articles from entertainment- and teen-oriented magazines, such as _Rona Barrett's Hollywood, 'Teen_ , and _TV Radio Mirror,_ as well as press releases from A&M Records. Also included are a number of articles from the _Southeast News_ and other publications from Downey, California—they offer a unique \"hometown\" perspective on the Carpenters.\n",
      "line is: For me, researching and collecting published material on the Carpenters became an ongoing pursuit that began in 1989. Most of the groundwork was done before the Internet became a commonplace research tool. I visited public and college libraries, rummaging through dusty shelves and scrolling through what had to be miles of microfilm in hopes of finding even one more piece of the puzzle. At some point, I realized that some of the best and most insightful articles on the Carpenters had been out of widespread circulation for years (and some never received wide circulation in the first place).\n",
      "line is: The first edition of _Yesterday Once More_ contained several pieces that were extensively edited or truncated for a variety of reasons. Almost all have been restored to their original form for this revised and expanded edition, though misspellings, style inconsistencies, and factual errors have been silently corrected.\n",
      "line is: This archival history of Karen and Richard Carpenter is intended to entertain and inform both the Carpenters neophyte and the die-hard Carpentersphile. I hope that, collectively, these articles will provide insight as to why the Carpenters continue to garner new fans and why their music seems to gain more respect the more it is reexamined.\n",
      "line is: What a super trip! Initially they took a \"Ticket to Ride\" (the Beatle classic), and the Carpenters, handsome six-foot Richard and his pretty brown-eyed sister Karen, rode nonstop to fame and fortune in the spinning of this 45-rpm disc on airwaves around the world. Their second record release, \"Close to You,\" proved an even bigger hit and the new sound introduced by the pair was sweeping the music industry—the same industry that had previously rejected their talents.\n",
      "line is: \"We were under contract to RCA Victor,\" recalls Richard with a catlike grin. \"But they wanted us to do instrumentals. We cut two records although I told them they would never sell. They were never even released as it turned out.\n",

      "line is: **W** hat makes a man cower before a powerful woman?\" I asked in my call for submissions for this book. What you'll find here are numerous answers to that question, though surely there are infinitely more waiting to be written. Men are the ones gifted with all sorts of power in our society, but our dirty little secret is that so many of them long to strip themselves of this power, to be tied down, gagged, spanked, taken, owned. They want to be made to do a woman's bidding, whether that means being ordered into a threesome or put on full, naked display, as you will read about here. They want to ease the burdens of manliness, if only for a little while, to be \"ordered\" to do all the naughty things they've dreamed of.\n",
      "line is: Submissive men are some of the most misunderstood and invisible sexual creatures around. Their voices simply aren't heard in popular culture, though you'll find them in plenty of bedrooms, in the blogosphere, and in fetish clubs. After putting together the anthologies _He's on Top_ and _She's on Top,_ I wanted  to look at BDSM from the bottom's perspective. Why would a man want to give up control? What does he get out of such an arrangement? These stories show you some of the tantalizing possibilities out there for sniveling men and the women who love them.\n",
      "line is: Men who crave the company of a dominant woman find her with wives, girlfriends, and dominatrices, sometimes bringing out the kinky tendencies of their partners, other times tapping into what's already well developed, yet we rarely hear their authentic voices telling us what makes them shiver with fear and excitement. There's still a taboo element to our leaders—in business, government, and the home—voluntarily relinquishing the top spot. Men are taught to be the hunters, not the hunted, and when the tables are turned, many are all too thrilled to be treated like scum. The flipside is that any woman who can lure a submissive man into her lair knows just how valuable a prize she's gotten and will surely want to keep him happy, even if this means putting her foot down, literally, upon him, as the boss in \"Secretary's Day\" does to her new hire.\n",
      "line is: \"Masturbation without permission was strictly forbidden. This was the most difficult for me because I got so worked up being Rikka's little whore that I desperately needed to jerk off,\" writes Alex Mendra in \"Zero Sum Game.\" He describes his setup with the commanding Rikka as \"perfection,\" striving to be everything she desires, but delighting in each form of punishment she cooks up, whether a firm spanking across his ass or the sudsy scene she cooks up for him.\n",
      "line is: In Stephen Elliott's \"It's Cold Outside,\" the element of realism he so beautifully captures takes us far beyond the clichéd Catwoman fantasy into the stuff of real life, where a woman commandeers the body of the narrator while her boyfriend is asleep. She leaves him tied up, helpless—and horny, and he takes  her marks with him, literally and figuratively, when they part.\n",
      "line is: In \"The Mean Girl,\" Teresa Noelle Roberts writes of a man reminiscing about his first fantasy domme, now embodied by his real-life Cruella. \"I tasted every humiliation I'd ever faced in my hopeless pursuit of Muffy Spaulding—made new and fresh and delicious because now it was coming from Heather, whom I loved. Whom I really did worship, kinky games aside.\"\n",
      "line is: There's also plenty of humor here. In \"A Different Kind of Reality Show\" by D. L. King, the author takes us behind the TV screen, where a man is controlled by a cacophony of women's voices, each taking more delight than the next in ordering him to humiliate himself for their pleasure.\n",
      "line is: Debra Hyde encapsulates perfectly why the \"unruly\" man doesn't just wish to be tamed, but needs to be. \"Fear no longer dominates; submission does. I am vessel and vassal—tool and toy, the means to her pleasure. I am hers.\" If those words resonate with you, making you long for a woman to come along and grab you by the scruff of your neck, or order you to your knees, or simply control you with one fierce, all-knowing look, then this is the book for you. Go ahead, say the words out loud: \"Yes, Ma'am.\" Wherever your domme is, she'll hear you.\n",
      "line is: _**B** end over,\" she says calmly. The ice in her voice makes my stomach pitch and roll with excitement—_\n",
      "line is: I've always been drawn to a certain type—women who are dark both in look and in spirit—and Rikka is no exception. We met at a decadent Halloween bash three years ago. She came dressed as a Gestapo Vampire Slut, and I was the Sweet Transvestite from Transsexual Transylvania.\n",
      "line is: When I first glimpsed her, there was that familiar tugging sensation that connects the pit of my stomach to my balls. She was tall and commanding in those thick-heeled, knee-high jack-boots and a short leather skirt. Jet black hair, spilling well past her strong shoulders, accented the pale translucence of her skin. Her lips, painted glossy red, were almost enough to distract the casual observer from stealing a glance at those firm, lush breasts. This was truly the woman of my wet dreams. Little did I know that her costume wasn't her only special outfit.\n",

Barbara and I had driven East on our honeymoon and were seeing old college mates for the first time since graduation in 1940, when France was falling, Italy was stabbing, and Britain was holding its breath.

I had already made up my mind to go, but was too scared to admit it to myself. A few weeks later when Tom came back to Dubuque to say good-bye to his family, having quit his job in New York, I told him I was going along with him, if it was all right with Barb and the British Embassy in Washington. Barbara cried when I asked her, nodded her head slowly, and as far as I know, that was the first of two times she cried during the war. I immediately wished she had put her foot down. This thing was gathering momentum.\n",

I awakened her, sat on the edge of the bed, and heard myself making words and I hoped some sense. Maybe it was because she was sleepy, but she seemed very calm, taking my hand, looking at the lifeline on the palm, studying it, and then patting my arm with the utmost confidence. \"We Richards live a long time. You will be all right.\"\n",

This gesture struck me as being cheap, melodramatic, an attempt to be glamorous. I had never fired a pistol, never wanted to, hoped I wouldn't have to, but Braden had said to bring a pistol. I was hurrying with the packing, though there was no rush, but I was trying to forget that perhaps I was playing the fool. My father-in-law had already spent fifteen minutes on the phone, trying to talk me out of it. I couldn't back out now. Tom seemed calm. I learned later he was in worse shape than I.\n",

      "line is: At the heart of all meditative practice in Asia is what Indians call _yoga_ , the system that \"yokes\" one's consciousness to a spiritually liberating discipline. In his _Yoga Sutra_ the ancient Indian philosopher Patanjali presents us with the possibility of complete psychological transformation through the discipline of yoga. Each of the 195 aphorisms that constitute the _Yoga Sutra_ is part of Patanjali's scheme for radically altering our conception of the world and the structure of thought through which we relate to it. The text is neither a sacred scripture nor a historical artifact, but a set of philosophical analyses that probe timeless dilemmas of cognition and obstacles to spiritual tranquility. Patanjali is not engaged in a search for new knowledge. Rather, he seeks a new perspective on the nature of knowing—a way to clear the mind of accumulated experiences and memories that bind us to a world of pain.\n",
      "line is: Yogic practice culminates in a state of spiritual freedom, an absolute calm beyond the realm of language and everyday experience. Although the freedom of yoga cannot be grasped by ordinary knowledge, it is not realized through mystical experience but through a logical series of meditative practices and hyperconscious thought experiments. Patanjali's method for achieving insight is far from the mystical ecstasy of a poet like St. John of the Cross or the ritual ecstasy of a shaman in a trance. It is instead a contemplative intensity that unbinds the constraints of everyday experience.\n",
      "line is: Yoga was known to the West in ancient times, but it gained wide attention in Europe and America only in the nineteenth century, first through the _Bhagavad Gita_ and later through Patanjali's _Yoga Sutra_ , In Europe, Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who was introduced to yoga through the philological studies of Wilhelm von Humbolt, considered it to be the central teaching of the _Bhagavad Gita_ and therefore to represent the core of Indian religion and philosophy. In America, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau were also deeply interested in the yoga of the _Bhagavad Gita_. In an 1849 letter to a friend, Thoreau wrote that he was, in his way, striving to practice \"the yoga\" faithfully and concluded that at \"rare intervals, even I am a yogi.\" While Thoreau's practical interest in yoga was consonant with his own ascetic and contemplative experiments, the rigors of yogic practice remained daunting to less-committed Westerners.\n",
      "line is: Yoga entered the public imagination in America a century ago in the person of an Indian yogi, Swami Vivekananda. The highly educated scion of a distinguished Bengali family, in his youth Vivekananda became a disciple of the Hindu mystic Ramakrishna, acknowledged throughout India as a saintly yogi. Before he died in 1886, Ramakrishna instructed his young disciple to carry his teachings into the world. In 1893 Vivekananda electrified the World Parliament of Religions at its meeting in Chicago with his speech on what he called _raja-yoga_ , the \"royal yoga.\" It was based on Patanjali's _Yoga Sutra_ , as interpreted by Ramakrishna. In 1894 Vivekananda initiated classes in New York on the Yoga school and on Vedanta, the dominant Hindu monistic philosophy rooted in ancient Vedic teachings. During a second visit to the United States in 1899, he founded the New York Vedanta Society and gave talks on _raja-yoga_ , which were published by the Society in a series of Vivekananda's teachings. The volume on _raja-yoga_ is a translation of Patanjali's work, with Vivekananda's commentary. Within the extensive body of Vivekananda's teachings on Yoga and Vedanta, his commentary on the devotional and service aspects of yoga supplement Patanjali's philosophical and meditative emphases. Many modern translations and commentaries on the _Yoga Sutra_ reflect Vivekananda's Vedantic conceptions, among them the well-known version of Christopher Isherwood and Swami Prabhavananda, entitled \"How to Know God.\" Isherwood, a British writer, was a great admirer of Vivekananda and a supporter of the Vedanta Society in California. Prabhavananda was a monk in the Vedanta lineage of Vivekananda.\n",
      "line is: The practice of postures, known as _haṭha-yoga_ , was given minimal attention by Vivekananda as the least important component of yogic practice. Even so, this physical dimension has been extremely popular in the West and is widely practiced as a way to promote health and mental tranquility. Although few practitioners venture into the philosophical landscape of Patanjali, his analysis of human thought processes underlies the teachings of most of the gurus of yoga who have come from India.\n",
      "line is: My own interest in Patanjali's text dates back more than twenty-five years, to when I read it as one of the foundation texts of Indian philosophy. As a philosophy student I was intrigued by the startling ways in which Patanjali analyzed epistemological problems and by the method of practice he offered to penetrate them. I have tried to practice yoga ever since. More recently, my work on the _Bhagavad Gita_ focused my attention on the concept of yoga and drew me back to Patanjali. An attempt to teach the _Yoga Sutra_ through extant translations convinced me of the need to rescue the text from the overly technical language and scholastic debates that obscure Patanjali's brilliant analysis of how the workings of thought trap us in misconceptions about ourselves and the world. I also saw the need to find consistent equivalents in English for Patanjali's core vocabulary, rather than perpetuating the loose array of incomprehensible technical inventions on which translators have too often relied. Furthermore, disputed meanings in the commentaries are frequently muddied in translation. For example, the keyword _citta_ , which most translators and commentators render as \"mind,\" is a major source of confusion. According to Patanjali mind is but one component of the mental structure, so I translate _citta_ as \"thought\" and maintain this distinction, as well as many others, in keeping with Patanjali's precision. I have appended a glossary that shows every occurrence of each keyword in Patanjali's system, thus enabling the reader to grasp the meaning of the term in its various contexts. As a further aid to comprehending the _Yoga Sutra_ , I have grouped the aphorisms into logical sections and commented on each group.\n",
      "line is: My commentary draws on traditional Indian commentaries. But rather than argue with the scholastics, I have made it my primary purpose to clarify the meaning of each aphorism from within the text. The meaning behind and within the technical references and arguments of certain sutras is highly controversial and is debated in the traditional commentaries. To penetrate most of these debates demands a control of the Sanskrit language and of the sources of Patanjali's ideas in Vedic, Buddhist, Jain, and epic literature. Fortunately, the basic insights offered in the _Yoga Sutra_ have a self-referential clarity that is independent of knowledge outside the text.\n",
      "line is: The text is in places highly technical, but not uniformly so. Not all sutras are equal in importance or in the complexity of their technical references and implied arguments. My translation is an attempt to make Patanjali's profound insights into the possibility of human spiritual freedom accessible to anyone intent on pondering the ideas of this ancient teaching.\n",
      "line is: I am grateful to the late Royal Weiler, in whose Sanskrit class I first read the _Yoga Sutra_ , where it was considered not only in terms of the traditional commentaries but also in the context of Buddhist psychology. It was my editor and friend Toni Burbank who urged me to make this basic text of Indian philosophy accessible to educated American readers. For their insights and critical comments on various versions of my translation and commentary, I thank Collett Cox, Madeleine Gins, Orrin Hein, Eric Huberman, Matthew Kapstein, Fred Smith, and my husband, Maxwell Greenwood. My final reading of the text has been deepened by the questions of students who struggled with me to unravel the meaning of Patanjali's dense Sanskrit aphorisms.\n",
      "line is: The aim of yoga is to eliminate the control that material nature exerts over the human spirit, to rediscover through introspective practice what the poet T. S. Eliot called the \"still point of the turning world.\" This is a state of perfect equilibrium and absolute spiritual calm, an interior refuge in the chaos of worldly existence. In the view of Patanjali, yogic practice can break habitual ways of thinking and acting that bind one to the corruptions of everyday life. Although the practice of yoga is much more ancient than the _Yoga Sutra_ , this brief text represents the earliest known systematic statement of the philosophical insights and practical psychology that define yoga. Through the centuries since its composition, it has been reinterpreted to meet the needs of widely divergent schools of Indian yoga, for which it remains an essential text.\n",
      "line is: More broadly, yoga refers to the complex system of physical and spiritual disciplines that is fundamental to Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu religious practice throughout Asia. The meditating figures of the Buddha and the Hindu god Shiva are familiar images in Asian religion. Sculptures show the Buddha seated in calm repose teaching his doctrine of universal compassion and the ascetic god Shiva in postures of perfect discipline. Hindu poets also evoke Shiva in his Himalayan retreat seated cross-legged and completely motionless, absorbed in pure contemplation, like an ocean without waves, the gates of his mind closed to outside intrusion as he meditates on the self within himself.\n",

      "line is: Regina, aka Reggie, Vaughn turned the key in her ten-year-old Escort and prayed the car would start. The plea was a daily ritual. The present state of her finances made replacing the aged vehicle impossible, so she relied on divine benevolence instead.\n",
      "line is: After two tries, the engine finally rumbled to life. The rusted green body shook and vibrated as if it was going to fly apart, but with her prayers answered, Regina backed down her grandmother's snow-lined driveway and headed off to her job at one of Detroit's most prestigious riverfront hotels.\n",
      "line is: She'd been on the hotel's staff for five years. Initially, she'd worked at the concierge desk, but when the economy hit bottom two years ago, so did the hospitality industry. Her position was eliminated, and it was either be laid off or take any opening the hotel had. She found a spot in housekeeping. It was good honest work and she made a point of doing it well. However, being downsized also meant bringing home a smaller paycheck, one that didn't pay enough to handle both her bills and college tuition, so finishing school had to wait. Having to withdraw had been disappointing, especially since she was just a few credits short of obtaining her bachelor's in Music Education. She wanted to become a music teacher. In her heart she knew her dreams would come true, but right now, she was just glad to have a job.\n",
      "line is: At the hotel, she parked in the employee lot and entered the building. Housekeeping was run out of a small office in the basement. Ms. Harold headed the operation and had been doing so for fourteen years.\n",
      "line is: As Reggie entered and punched in, Ms. Harold called out, \"Morning, Reg.\"\n",
      "line is: \"I'd be better if Trina hadn't called in sick again. You'll have to cover her floors today. Sorry.\"\n",
      "line is: Reggie wanted to jump up and down and throw a tantrum at the idea of all the extra work, but because she was twenty-seven and not seven, she said simply, \"Okay. I'll see you later.\" Sighing, she left Ms. Harold and headed off to start her day.\n",
      "line is: On the way to the room where the housekeepers changed out of street clothes and into their uniforms, she gave a wave to the waiters, valets and other service employees she passed. The hotel's underground hive was already up and running, and she felt good still being a member of such a dedicated and award-winning staff.\n",
      "line is: Trina, however, was another story. She was Reggie's best friend. They'd been close as sisters since fourth grade. Where Reggie's dream was to be a music teacher, Trina's was to become a beautician with her own shop. Reggie rooted for Trina's dream just like Trina rooted for Reggie's, but when it came to work outside of a beauty shop, Trina was not the most diligent employee.\n",
      "line is: Reggie entered the changing room, pulled on the shapeless gray dress that was her uniform, buckled the shiny belt and went to grab one of the carts that held all the towels, bedding and other necessities she'd need to spend the next eight hours cleaning rooms.\n",
      "line is: Upstairs on the twenty-fifth floor, multi-award-winning music producer Jamal Reynolds checked himself out in the mirror. Tall and dark skinned, he knew he was a good-looking man, but that wasn't what drove his personality. The simple black turtleneck and black slacks were expensive but made him look casual and comfortable as opposed to the millionaire the music industry knew him to be. He preferred it that way. He wasn't into blinding people with bling or hanging so much gold around his neck that he had to walk bent over. His work was his focus and the only bling he cared about were the Grammys and Platinum awards he and his stable of artists displayed on the walls of their homes back in L.A. At present, he was on his way to a breakfast in conjunction with the fiftieth-anniversary celebration of Grady Records, one of the pioneering recording companies of R & B. At thirty-three, Jamal was too young to have grown up owning any of the Grady hits, but he and everyone else in the music business owed their careers to the tracks laid down fifty years ago by the great Charles Grady.\n",

      "line is: Tears drizzled down her cheeks. She knew that what she contemplated was madness. Yet she had no other options, no place to go, no one to trust. She closed her eyes for a second, took a deep breath of salty sea air, thought of all the might-have-beens that now were only lost dreams.

      "line is: Before Katie's death, I saw our beginning clearly. I told the story about dancing at a party in Dhaka, both of us a little drunk and each of us saying something clever. I described the bus ride that next month and my taking the empty seat next to hers; how Katie pulled my arm over her and leaned into me so matter-of-factly that when my arm fell asleep I did not move it, not even as I lost feeling into the shoulder, so that we might keep talking about the families, hometowns, and friends back home we would most likely never meet, imagining ourselves and our lives in enough detail that we seemed to know each other instantly. Dinner the next night in Dhaka. The park where we finally noticed the security guard watching us. The morning a mutual friend looked at Katie's neck and said, _Man, this hangover sucks harder than Big John_.\n",
      "line is: I tell myself now that I will not reanimate a ghost; that if the fact of Katie's death ends our life together, then I can make no sequence of events that does not also initiate tragedy. Why begin with optimism a story that must dissemble reluctance and violence?\n",
      "line is: There is a competing claim to this logic, a way of making the past that seeks emphasis and invention, rather than sequence. Say it is the difference between closing down every possibility into some broad lie, on the one hand, and finding instead the feeling, however disjointed, that makes the senseless and violent end of a life something more deeply felt than the trivial anecdote of its sensational facts. Before Katie's death, I would not think to make a distinction between how our life began and how the feeling of the marriage was invented and sustained. I didn't have to make the distinction. The fact of our marriage, not Katie's death, was the decisive moment of our life together.\n",
      "line is: It feels good to tell an exceptional story about us, one that makes certain virtues essential—selflessness, service, privation—in unlikely places no one we knew had visited or was likely to visit. _Katie and I were Peace Corps volunteers who fell in love in Bangladesh, made a life in Chicago and Miami, and then went abroad one last time to Romania, where we lived for the last year of her life_. In such a story, we arrive, always, at another place. We are young, idealistic, selfless, hard-working. We are an idea of ourselves, fixed in that time, which is now lost forever.\n",
      "line is: What were we doing in the middle of Bangladesh? We were dating. We were serving our country and changing lives. Bangladesh _isn't_ _real_ ; we said this to each other constantly. We lived in sparse, cement-walled rooms rented from our schools. We took buses, rickshaws, and two-cycle motor taxis to leave them. Smog made our phlegm black. Red circles marked wells drilled into arsenic. We tested our water and carried it in ten-gallon plastic barrels from the well to the front gate of our schools, where we taught hygiene classes and met with local politicians, who drew phonetic squares and drilled the _z_ and _j_ sounds.\n",
      "line is: My students said I looked and sounded like President Clinton: tall, young, and midwestern, with blond hair and thick-rimmed glasses. To them all Americans looked the same. When President Clinton visited that spring on his last world tour in office, the entire Peace Corps contingent stood in a cluster opposite the runway, watching Air Force One and waiting to greet him. We shook the hands of senators and aides as his procession arrived at the airport. President Clinton wore a new suit that afternoon, blue with a gold tie, tailored by a local Bangladeshi. He was leonine, wary. He looked each of us in the eye, and somehow he knew to stop and ask the volunteer from Arkansas where she had gone to high school. We smiled and cheered. Then, he was gone, up the stairwell, which rolled into a larger cargo plane further down the runway. Plane after plane disappeared into the night sky. Wouldn't we leave Bangladesh so gracefully?\n",
      "line is: In the beginning, when I hadn't seen Katie for a few weeks, her face seemed sharper than it did the last time, her eyes a different blue. There was nuance in her voice, her laugh round and smooth in a way that I didn't quite remember. Had her front teeth always had that gap? Was that scar over her left or right eye? Always, one of us had gained or lost weight. Katie wore raw silk and a hand-sewn cotton shalwar in public, covering her face, making her body shapeless. Sometimes I heard her voice before I saw her mouth. I thought of it as running the dub on a video: trying to synch words with lips. The effect lasted only a few minutes, but I remember thinking it was strange, that I could imagine someone so vividly in her absence that she might seem to become someone else.\n",
      "line is: The Peace Corps was a finishing school, a nondenominational cult, a secular house of worship. We spoke in acronyms—RPCV, PST, IST, PCMO, APCD—that meant we lived on the other side of the world, where the water was not clean, the roads were not paved, and the people were impressed by our relative size. All of this distinction required a separate and secret code of efficient communication. Americans were tall and well fed. We nourished babies that thrived. On the walls of our rooms were photographs of handsome, wealthy people: family members, in fact, who lived in our family homes.\n",
      "line is: When the Peace Corps conducted official business, its representatives arrived in enormous sport-utility vehicles, with tinted windows and chrome grills across the headlights. Officers and staff members in crisp shirts and bland ties wore expensive watches and, always, sunglasses. They broke into sweats immediately, because their cars in the monsoon heat had been cooled for hours to artic temperatures. But they spoke the language. They drank whatever was offered them. In this way the Peace Corps was an ideal, an argument, a mobile promised land working a methodical, slow reveal. We volunteers were its prophets, the elect ambassadors who made our country beautiful by example. We carried backpacks and wore sandals, but everyone seemed to understand that if we were threatened, a battalion of marines would arrive instantly and extract us into the sky.\n",
      "line is: Katie applied to the Peace Corps, she said, because she hated hearing John Lennon and Yoko Ono's \"Happy Christmas! (War Is Over)\" in shopping malls, at holiday parties, and especially late at night, by request, when she delivered pizzas in the Twin Cities. Why was the song following her, and what did it want from her? She didn't know. She was not doing enough to help the world, she believed, because if she was doing enough, then John Lennon and Yoko Ono would not hound her to do more.\n",
      "line is: I applied to the Peace Corps, I told her, because everyone I admired at my university was applying to the Peace Corps. It was a process to begin that took more than a year to complete, becoming more elaborate and specific with each successive interview, medical exam, and clearance, until the selected were understood to be, in every way, exceptional. I loved the sense of momentum and possibility. The experience and destination would change me, I agreed. I could think of it only in the abstract, how my time in the Peace Corps might make me vital and return me home transformed.\n",

      "line is: The smell of blood woke me. It was intense, as though my whole body were inhaling it. It reverberated and expanded within me. Strange scenes flitted through my mind—the fuzzy yellow light of a row of street lamps in the fog, swirling water below my feet, a crimson umbrella rolling along a rain-soaked road, a plastic tarpaulin shrouding a construction site snapping in the wind. Somewhere a man was singing and slurring lyrics: a song about a girl he couldn't forget, and about her walking in the rain.\n",
      "line is: It didn't take me long to figure out what was going on. None of this was reality or even the remnants of a dream. It was a signal my head was sending my body. Stay lying down. Don't move. It's the price you have to pay for not taking your medication.\n",
      "line is: Not taking my meds was a quenching rain in the desert of my life, even if it sometimes caused a seizure. Right now, I was experiencing the unsettling hallucinations that warned me a storm was imminent. There was no safe harbor; I could only wait for it to arrive. If past experience was any indication, when it was over, I wouldn't remember what had happened. It would be simple and intense, and afterward I would be tired and depleted. I deserved this; I knew full well what I was getting into when I chose this path. It was an addiction; I kept doing it again and again despite understanding the risks. Most addicts get high to chase after a fantasy, but for me it was a different route: I had to get _off_ my drugs to reach a heightened reality. That was when the magic hours opened up—my headaches and tinnitus disappeared, and my senses became acute. I could smell like a dog, my brain whirred quicker than ever, and I read the world by instinct instead of with reason. I felt empowered and superior.\n",
      "line is: Even then, I still had tiny dissatisfactions. I never felt superior to Mother and Auntie. These two women treated me like a seat cushion—something to be suffocated and smothered. I knew what the chain of events would be if Mother were to witness me having a seizure. As soon as I recovered, she would drag me straight to Auntie, the famous psychiatrist and director of Future Pediatric Clinic. Auntie would look into my eyes and talk to me kindly to try to get me to listen to her. _Why did you stop taking your pills? Tell me honestly, so I can help you._ Frankly, though, honesty is neither my strong suit nor something I aspire to. I prefer to be practical, so my answer would be: _I forgot to take it one day, then the next day I forgot that I'd forgotten the day before, and while_ _I'm at it, why don't I just say that I've forgotten about it every day until this very moment?_ Auntie would declare that I was falling into another dangerous pattern, and Mother would order me to take the pills at each meal under observation. They would drill into me the steep price I would pay for a few thrilling days, making it clear that as long as I continued to behave this way, I would never be free of their gaze.\n",
      "line is: Suddenly Mother's voice popped into my head. I had heard it, soft but clear, right before I woke up. But now I couldn't even hear her moving about downstairs. It was so quiet. A deafening stillness. It was dark in my room; maybe it was still early, before the sun was up. She might still be asleep. Then I could have this seizure and be done with it without her having to know about it, like last night.\n",
      "line is: Around midnight, I'd stood panting near the sea wall on my way back from a run to the Milky Way Observatory in Gundo Marine Park. I ran when I got restless and felt my muscles twitching with energy. I thought of it as \"restless body syndrome.\" Sometimes I ran in the middle of the night; it wouldn't be exaggerating to call it a mad urge.\n",
      "line is: The streets were deserted, as they always were at that hour. Yongi's, the street stall that sold sugar-filled pancakes, was closed. The ferry dock below was shrouded in darkness. Thick fog had swallowed the six-lane road by the sea wall. The December wind was biting and powerful, and a torrential rain was falling. Most would consider these adverse conditions, but I felt as though I was floating in the air. I felt fantastic. I could float all the way home. It would have been perfect if it hadn't been for the sweet smell of blood perfuming the wind, suggesting an impending seizure. A girl got off the last bus to Ansan and tottered toward me with her umbrella held open, pushed along by the wind. I had to get home; I didn't want to crumple to the ground and roll around, contorted like a squid thrown on the grill, in front of a complete stranger.\n",
      "line is: I couldn't remember what happened after that. I must have lain down as soon as I walked into my room, without bothering to change. I probably fell asleep snoring. It had been the third seizure I'd had in my life, but this was the first time I'd sensed another one coming so quickly after the last. And this smell was a different beast altogether: my skin was stinging, my nose was tingling and my mind was foggy. The episode that was about to come felt like it could be the most intense one yet.\n",
      "line is: I wasn't anxious about the seizure's severity; whether it was a drizzle or a downpour, I'd still get wet. I just wished it would come quickly so that I could be done with it before Mother woke up. I closed my eyes and stayed still. I turned my head to the side to prevent any possible breathing distress. I relaxed my body and breathed deeply. One, two... When I got to five, the cordless phone on my bedside table began to ring, jolting me out of my preparations. I flinched, knowing it would be ringing downstairs in the living room too. Mother would startle awake. What bastard calls in the middle of the night?\n",
      "line is: The phone stopped ringing. The grandfather clock took over and chimed just once in the living room. As well as ringing out on the hour, the clock chimed once every thirty minutes. I reached over to the alarm clock by my bed and peeked at the display: 5:30. Waking early was a legacy from my years of competitive swimming. No matter what time I fell asleep, I would wake up one hour before practice. That meant that Mother must be sitting at the writing desk in her room, reciting Hail Marys to the statue of the Virgin Mary.\n",
      "line is: After she prayed, Mother would take a shower. I listened for a dragging chair or running water, but all I could hear was the loud ringing of the phone. This time it was my cell. Maybe the earlier call had been for me too.\n",

He felt in his pocket for a packet of cigarettes, took one out and lit it. He wiped the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand and he stood in the middle of the street looking around him.\n",

The sea was calm and black. He could clearly make out the line of hills on the mainland in the distance and he estimated that it was about eight miles away. He bent down again to rub his ankle. 'God dammit,' he said. 'There must be some of them still alive.' But there was no noise anywhere, and there was a stillness about the buildings and about the whole village which made it seem as though the place had been dead for a thousand years.\n",

It was a grey shirt with thin black stripes. He looked at the pilot and he was like a blind man who looks towards something but does not see.\n",

      "line is: My high school chemistry teacher was also a forensics investigator. He specialized in arson, burned bodies, and flammable chemicals, and he entertained us with sometimes-gruesome stories from more than twenty-five years of duty. There was the skeleton of a woman, average height—which is to say five-foot-four—somewhere around thirty years old, reduced to blackened bones and cinders in a house fire. He gave us two clues: \"For example, the middle finger on her right hand has a large calcification on the top section, like you might have if you wrote heavily with a pencil, for example.\" He said \"for example\" at the beginning and end of everything. \"For example, she also has a tiny indentation, a notch, in her front tooth, also the right one, for example.\" It was our job as eager students, wound up by the grisly details, to figure out her occupation.\n",
      "line is: Work changes you. It shows itself on your body. In the same way that a carpenter's hands are tuned to the nuances of hammer and nail, the way wood can talk to you through your arms, my hands listen to numbers on files, to injection records and saturation levels, to painful and courageous histories. I filter through the hundreds of thousands (could be millions) of dead medical records at St. Vincent's Hospital, and line them up in ascending order by year of admittance.\n",
      "line is: The files begin with a complaint. Something like \"My back hurts and I don't know why,\" or \"My leg is broken,\" or worse things—usually only one sentence, typed up by someone in Admitting. Then a social and family history, which is dictated to the nurse by the patient, and handwritten. This is where the nurses fill in what's really happening, the stuff that doesn't show up in the complaint: \"Woman claims to have walked into door,\" or \"Child has bruises on back and legs, father says they are from falling off the bed.\" Then a medical history, a list of procedures performed, if any, and finally billing information. Sometimes there are X-rays, sometimes there are sonograms. Sometimes there's hardly anything—a blurry carbon copy and illegible signature. The files are stored vertically on shelves in thirty-two rows. They're accented by six different color-coded stickers (green for first-time emergency visit, orange for same-day dismissal, red for DOA, yellow, brown, and light blue for what I haven't been able to figure out yet).\n",
      "line is: My fingertips are tough, callused by the constant shuffling and reshuffling of paperwork and paper clips, removing the tiny staples, and my cuticles are often rubbed red and raw from jamming my hands in between two folders, cut open on the sharp edges of the files.\n",
      "line is: I work alone. I don't talk to anyone, don't see anyone. I don't know who deposits the manila folders into the wire in-box. I only know that when I arrive, the box is full, and the files are sometimes spilling over into two or even three stacks on the carpet. I work when I want to, so long as I've made a hefty dent at the end of the week. I don't make enough money to get by on this job alone, so I hustle. Truthfully, I was hustling before I took this job, and if you ever see a documentary film about strippers, or prostitutes, or hustlers, they always say something like: \"I couldn't make enough money waiting tables, so I started turning tricks and here I am.\"\n",
      "line is: The fact that I work alone also means that, in some ways, I have no proof of the work at all. I have no product. Other than my fingers, I have nothing to show for it, no physical manifestation of time passing. Hustling is the same. If I flatten myself out enough (in my head, I mean) then it's easily forgettable. And because it's a secret, an almost invisible transaction between strangers, it doesn't really exist. But I will—reluctantly—say this: all the anonymous numbers, all those forgotten histories, the injuries and surgeries and remarkable recoveries, they hide in my fingers. Where the sex work goes, I don't know.\n",

      "line is: When I look over at my hand holding the armrest of the door, my fist is clenched tight around the brown leather and the dust starts to settle over my eyes. I reach down and start rubbing my finger across his asshole, then pushing it up until I can't get in any farther. He squirms, then moans. Not pleasure or pain. It's a moan of not knowing, of losing control. There is no before and there is no after, there is only now, like the queasy instant just before you sneeze.\n",

A divine blessing!... At last, the Angel of Death has released this poor tormented creature from the Devil's possession!\"\n",

Hardly moving, Giovanna stood, tensed, waiting. Not that she expected to actually see anything materialize, but the nuns had taught her of the special wonder of all beings having a soul that must rise, leave what was newly dead, and although she knew this particular soul would not, could not, desert her mother—still, she felt compelled to wait out its required time to do so.\n",
      "line is: \"Look! The child is standing vigil!\" the widows whispered, impressed. Giovanna heard them as faint background to her concentration. Hugging herself, her eyes fixed on her mother's body, she tensed, ready to catch her soul, push it back, protect it from the flames of Hell she was so certain would be waiting to consume it.\n",

Not lighting her bedside candle, she climbed onto the small trestle bed. Fully clothed, thin arms crossed upon her chest, she lay like her mother below and cried. Throughout her life, Giovanna would grieve in this way, without moving, without sound, in silent sorrow.\n",

      "line is: A Jewish wife will forgive and forget, but she'll never forget what she forgave.\n",
      "line is: \"Joe who?\" my mother asked without guile from her hospital bed. She'd just read a card that had been tucked into a glorious bouquet of freshly delivered flowers.\n",
      "line is: \"Joe Heller,\" I told her. I was flabbergasted that she didn't know or couldn't guess, but then we were in Sloan-Kettering. It was 1995, she was dying, and although my parents had been married for thirty-eight years, they had had a particularly acrimonious divorce twelve years before and had not spoken since. So perhaps the fact that she was scouring her brain for non-Hellerian Joes she might know was not really all that startling. I reached over for the card and read aloud: \"My darling Shirley,\" it began, \"I am so sorry. Joe.\" I handed it back to her.\n",
      "line is: When I told her who'd sent the flowers, she spoke slowly and without rancor. \"Well, he is a sorry soul,\" she pronounced wearily, crumpling up the card and dropping it into the yellow plastic trash bin on the floor beside her bed. \"But he sent you flowers,\" I pushed, somehow hoping for more. \"Th ey're from Dad. Don't you think they're nice?\" I pestered, leading the witness. She stared at me, unruffled and unimpressed. \"I get it. I understand,\" she said. \"But really, how wildly would you like me to celebrate this? Should I hire jugglers?\" Then she muttered something that I made her repeat twice because it was said so faintly, she closed her eyes and we never spoke of the flowers or of my father again.\n",
      "line is: By then my mother was bald and terribly frail. After her initial diagnosis a year and a half earlier, I'd moved back in with her at the Apthorp, the apartment building where I'd grown up, decamping from the Upper East Side to properly care for her for as long as was needed.\n",
      "line is: From the day I moved back in, whether my mother was home or, as she was with increasing frequency, in the hospital, my father was too stubborn and too shaken by the gravity of her illness to call or speak to her. Instead, he called me. Night after night he inquired about her with an array of questions that never varied: Had she eaten? Had she gotten fresh air that day? Was she able to sleep? What were the doctors saying? Had she taken all of her medications and had I remembered to give her all of her vitamins? What was her mood? Every night I answered him, increasingly baffled by his persistent interest and concern, but not, I suspect, as baffled as he himself may have been.\n",
      "line is: As my mother got sicker, had brain surgery, lung surgery, chemo, and radiation, I could hear how much more difficult it was for him to keep the fear from creeping into his voice. He knew we were going to lose her. It was only a question of when. Officially, they had lost each other many years before, of course, but it was obvious how deeply he was tied to her. They were still uncannily connected.\n",
      "line is: Even after years of silence, the truth remained that there'd never been anyone who'd known or understood each of them better than the other. There never would be. With Mom's death, this aspect of my father's life would be obliterated, and I sensed that fact very strongly during that time. To me, it could easily be seen lurking just beneath the surface—a surface customarily guarded and closed and, for the most part, ineluctably indecipherable.\n",
      "line is: When my father called me those nights he was not the blustery, famous author; the gruff, arrogant big shot; the smug, cocky fellow who sometimes showed up to friends' cocktail parties for the sheer fun of insulting them. He wasn't the caustic, clever master of the verbal arabesque who for years had answered the question \"How come you've never written a book as good as Catch-22?\" with the sly, Talmudic response to put any other to shame: \"Who has?\" he'd ask, genuinely wanting to know. He was not bombastic or self-satisfied during those nightly calls. He was only sad. He just wanted to talk, and I let him.\n",
      "line is: Then, about a month before my mother died, when she had gone into Sloan-Kettering for what seemed as if it might be the last time, one night when Dad called I was simply too exhausted to hold everything back that I'd been wanting to say to him ever since she'd first been diagnosed. I had never found the courage or the proper words to use with him before.\n",
      "line is: I blurted out that he simply had to communicate with her again now, or he would never forgive himself. \"How will you live with yourself if you don't? How will you sleep at night?\" I asked in an uncustomarily loud tone. He listened silently, and I could picture him sitting in his lemon-yellow study out in East Hampton where he lived, seething at the very notion of being scolded by his daughter. \"Call. Write to her. Send flowers. Do something. There isn't much time left, and if you don't, I think you'll always be sorry,\" I fumbled, suddenly aware of and horrified by my own stridence. Now, understandably, there was angry silence. When Dad finally spoke, he was petulant, childlike. \"I don't need you to tell me what to do,\" he growled, hanging up before I could respond.\n",

      "line is: While I managed to learn the words, memorizing isn't the same as _understanding._ And of course I was never tested on the meaning of the pledge. It must have simply been taken for granted that even the dimmest child would easily grasp the meaning of a phrase such as _I pledge allegiance,_ especially when that phrase was spoken while standing at strict attention and facing the American flag, hand in a salute above the heart. There was so little room for misinterpretation. It was the Pledge of Allegiance, not _Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret._\n",
      "line is: _Still._ If one of the teachers had asked me to explain the meaning of those words—which I chanted parrot-minded and smiling each morning—they certainly would have been shocked to hear me admit that while I didn't know _exactly_ what it was about, I knew it had something to do with Pledge, the same furniture polish my mother used and that always, inexplicably, made me feel sunny. So each morning as I spoke those hallowed words, it was the bright yellow can with the glowing lemony scent that I pictured.\n",

Another three months and she'd be gone, taking a roundabout route across Europe and Asia en route home to New South Wales. She'd miss the people, if not the place, and she'd definitely miss her job as a nanny. Max was a real little livewire; blond, cherubic, but with a mischievous streak and an ability to make her laugh out loud.\n",

In the next second, she felt a gloved hand grab her round the mouth and nose, cutting off her breath, and she was dragged back hard in the seat. She started to struggle, lashing out in panic, caught out by the brute force of her assailant, but almost immediately she felt a sharp, stinging pain in her neck, like an injection. But this was no injection. She could see the collar of her jacket turning a vivid red colour, and all the strength seemed to flow out of her like air from a deflating balloon. Still unable to comprehend fully what was happening as the blood continued to pour over her clothes, she managed to look over at Max – dear, sweet Max – only seven years old. He too was struggling in his seat as someone sitting behind him held a cloth over his face. And then, as his body went limp, Gina realized that she too was blacking out, and that this was the end. There would be no waking up from this.\n",
      "line is: Behind her, the killer moved fast. His name was Phil Vermont and he was a big man. Taking a deep breath, he carefully removed the knife from the au pair's neck, wiping it on a tissue, and got out of the car, stretching. They'd been waiting in the back of the Freelander for the last half-hour and the cold and discomfort had played havoc with his back. Opening the driver's door, he hauled the au pair out of the car, careful to avoid getting blood on either the seat or his clothes, and dragged her round the side of the double garage. He wasn't worried about being seen from the road. The Hortons' house was hidden behind security gates and a high hedge. It was supposed to make the place secure, but all it did was make it easier for people like Vermont and his accomplice to operate.\n",

There are two vertical furrows between my eyes that make me appear to be wearing a continual scowl. My eyes are wide enough apart and not small, but they are hard, cold, calculating. They are blue, but of that shade of blue farthest removed from the violet.\n",

I do not scowl, I do not sneer; yet there is something in my face that causes a man or woman to hesitate before asking to be directed to Dr. Gordon's church. I can't remember a time that any woman, young or old, ever stopped me on the street and asked to be directed. Once in a great while a drunk will roll over to where I am standing and ask how he can get to \"Tw'-ninth 'n' Mission.\"\n",

She is looking into my eyes intently and I am wondering what she is going to say to me when the crunching of gravel warns us that the old coach is ready and I must be off.

That's the way it should have been, but wasn't.\n",
      "line is: The course I followed from that convent school to this library desk, if charted on a piece of paper, would look like the zigzag line that statisticians use to denote the rise and fall of temperature or rainfall or fluctuations of business. Every turn I made was a sharp one, a sudden one. In years I cannot remember making one easy, graceful, rounded turn.\n",

It seems to explain to me why the man who so proudly says, \"This is my mother,\" is so many things that I am not and never can be. The insurance people have not yet got to the stage of insuring a man against a lifetime of failure, but if they ever do, I imagine the chap who can guarantee them that he will keep his mother with him until he is twenty will have a shade the best of it when he pays his premium.\n",
      "line is: I am not lugging in the fact that I was left motherless at the age of ten to alibi myself away from anything. Nevertheless I think a fellow has the right to ask himself if things might not have been different. My mother died before I got very well acquainted with her—I doubt if any child gives its parents much thought before the age of twelve or thirteen.\n",
      "line is: I probably thought that my mother was a person put into the world to scrub my face and neck and to be screamed and kicked at; to put scratchy, flannel rags around my neck with smelly grease on them when I had the croup; and to stand by the bed and keep me in it when I had the measles. I can remember distinctly how angry I became when she brought me a nice, new toothbrush and showed me what to do with it.\n",

      "line is: We are in the middle of some kind of short fiction boom in science fiction and the associated genres of the fantastic. Not an economic boom, but certainly a numbers increase, and it has been building for several years. There seems to have been an increase in quality as well as in quantity, too, with well-edited semiprofessional magazines and small press anthologies of generally higher editorial standards than those anthologies issuing from big trade publishers proliferating. And all this in spite of the desperate battles of the distinguished professional magazines to secure enough distribution and sales to persist in business.\n",
      "line is: The electronic publishers on the internet maintained the levels of quality established a couple of years back, and remain a vigorous dimension of the SF field, but there was not a significant increase in the amount of good fiction originating on the internet. The increase was predominantly in the semiprofessional book and magazine publishing sphere, and even in the zine area (as opposed to fanzines—zines are analogous to the cutting edge little magazines of the literary world, published and carefully edited by individuals, rarely for profit).\n",
      "line is: Still, the highest concentrations of excellence were in the professional publications, the anthologies from the small press, and the highest paying online markets. The electronic fiction websites such as Infinite Matrix, Strange Horizons, and SciFiction continued to publish much fine work, though a majority of it was fantasy or horror.\n",
      "line is: There were hundreds of good stories to choose from this year to fill this volume (there were more than five hundred listed as candidates for the Locus recommended reading list for the year), making it clear that there are a really large number of talented writers of short fiction in our field, a real bonanza for readers. There are a lots of conclusions one might draw from this, but the one we highlight is that it makes this year's best volume even more useful, since we try to sort through all this material. The small press really did expand again this past year, both in book form and in a proliferation of little magazines, in the U.S. and the rest of the world.\n",
      "line is: Once again, books and magazines of high quality, often anthologies and short story collections, from Canada, Australia, and the UK, drew our attention. We have to say that this year was generally as good as the pinnacle year 2003 for original anthologies and story collections—even though most of them will not be found in local bookstores because they are available on the whole only by direct mail or internet order, or from specialty dealers at SF conventions. Still, the total of good SF stories, and perhaps even the total of all SF stories, increased noticeably last year.\n",
      "line is: But—and this is a significant but—the majority of small press publications contained only a minority of science fiction genre stories, and the bulk of the rest were speculative literature, fantasy, horror, magical realism, allegories, or uses of SF tropes and images in the context of mainstream or postmodern fiction. This commonly proceeded from a \"breaking the bounds of genre\" attitude on the part of the editors and publishers of small press short fiction, and many of their writers. Distinguished examples of this trend are Leviathan and Polyphony.\n",
      "line is: And to our continuing amusement, this attitude was again contradicted by one of the bastions of mainstream literary fiction, McSweeney's magazine, which published a second genre fiction issue, McSweeney's Astonishing Stories, in 2004, edited by Michael Chabon. It was filled mainly with genre stories, although no SF this time. Perhaps more significantly, the prestigious Denver Quarterly had an issue devoted principally to fantastic fiction without announcing the fact at all. Each year we find ourselves pointing with some irony at the areas of growth in SF, as if they were double-edged swords. While many of the ambitious insiders want to break out, at least some ambitious outsiders are breaking in, and some of them at the top of the genre. This is now a trend several years old.\n",
      "line is: It is our opinion that it is a good thing to have genre boundaries. If we didn't, young writers would have to find something else to transgress to draw attention to themselves.\n",
      "line is: So, for readers new to this series, we repeat our usual disclaimer: This selection of science fiction stories represents the best that was published during the year 2004. It would take several more volumes this size to have nearly all of the best short stories—though even then, not all of the best novellas. And we believe that representing the best from year to year, while it is not physically possible to encompass it all in one even very large book, also implies presenting some substantial variety of excellences, and we left some worthy stories out in order to include others in this limited space.\n",
      "line is: Our general principle for selection: This book is full of science fiction—every story in this book is clearly that and not something else. We have a high regard for horror, fantasy, speculative fiction, and slipstream, and postmodern literature. We (Kathryn Cramer and David G. Hartwell) edit the Year's Best Fantasy in paperback from Eos, as a companion volume to this one—look for it if you enjoy short fantasy fiction, too. But here, we choose science fiction.\n",
      "line is: We try in each volume of this series to represent the varieties of tones and voices and attitudes that keep the genre vigorous and responsive to the changing realities out of which it emerges, in science and daily life. It is supposed to be fun to read, a special kind of fun you cannot find elsewhere. This is a book about what's going on now in SF. The stories that follow show, and the story notes point out, the strengths of the evolving genre in the year 2004.\n",

There, wandering through high barren rooms full of conceptual art, alone on a Thursday afternoon, Lucinda Hoekke and Matthew Plangent felt certain they wouldn't be tempted to do more than talk. Too, driving into the canyon of vacated plazas of downtown Los Angeles felt suitably solemn and irrevocable. The plan was not to sever as friends, or as bandmates, only as lovers.\n",
      "line is: Lucinda saw him first. A tall, malnourished vegetarian, Matthew was obliviously handsome, lead-singer handsome. He was dressed as for his work at the zoo and for the band's practices, in black turtleneck, jeans, and speckless suede work boots, which Lucinda knew he kept in his locker when he entered the animals' habitats. Matthew had presumably been excused from his veterinary nursing duties for the afternoon, or possibly it was his day off. For the past four years Lucinda had been assembling espresso drinks and clearing dishes at the Coffee Chairs, but she'd quit her job the day before, part of the same program of change that included this final rupture with Matthew. Instead, to pay her rent Lucinda had agreed to work for her friend Falmouth Strand in his storefront gallery.\n",
      "line is: On her way into the museum Lucinda had paused at two heroic pillars of neon, mounted on either side of a doorway, and seen only versions of herself and Matthew: discrete, sealed, radiant. Now, sighting Matthew, she felt her senses quicken, her balance shifting to her toes. He squinted warily at a television monitor on a white pediment, some sort of video art. Perhaps it was the case that for him, as for her, everything in the museum had been reduced to an allegory of their dilemma. Exhausted by the old tug of his beauty, his scruffy intensity and lean limbs, Lucinda was ready to send Matthew and his allure out voyaging elsewhere.\n",

I have found my birth father and eight half brothers and sisters I didn't know I had. I have met my mother's relatives in Ethiopia, but when I ask them to describe my mother, they throw out generalities. \"She was nice,\" they tell me. \"She was pretty.\" \"She was smart.\" _Nice, pretty, smart_. The words seem meaningless, except the last is a clue because even today, in rural Ethiopia, girls are not encouraged to go to school. That my mother was intelligent rings true because I know she had to be shrewd to save the lives of myself and my sister, which is what she did, in the most mysterious and miraculous of ways.\n",
      "line is: My mother's family never owned a photograph of her, which tells you everything you need to know about where I'm from and what the world was like for the people who gave me life. In 1972, in the United States, Polaroid introduced its most popular instant camera. In 1972, the year my mother died, an Ethiopian woman could go her whole life without having her picture taken—especially if, as was the case with my mother, her life was not long.\n",
      "line is: I have never seen a picture of my mother, but I know how she cooked. For me, my mother is _berbere_ , an Ethiopian spice mixture. You use it on everything, from lamb to chicken to roasted peanuts. It's our salt and pepper. I know she cooked with it because it's in the DNA of every Ethiopian mother. Right now, if I could, I would lead you to the red tin in my kitchen, one of dozens I keep by the stove in my apartment in Harlem, filled with my own blend and marked with blue electrical tape and my own illegible scrawl. I would reach into this tin and grab a handful of the red-orange powder, and hold it up to your nose so you could smell the garlic, the ginger, the sundried chili.\n",
      "line is: My mother didn't have a lot of money so she fed us _shiro_. It's a chickpea flour you boil, kind of like polenta. You pour it into hot water and add butter, onions, and _berbere_. You simmer it for about forty-five minutes, until it's the consistency of hummus, and then you eat it with injera, a sour, rich bread made from a grain called teff. I know this is what she fed us because this is what poor people eat in Ethiopia. My mother carried the chickpea powder in her pocket or bag. That way, all she needed to make dinner was water and fire. Injera is also portable, so it is never wasted. If you don't finish it, you leave it outside and let it dry in the sun. Then you eat it like chips.\n",

      "line is: TWO THINGS TO get straight from the beginning: I hate doctors and have never joined a support group in my life. At seventy-three, I'm not about to change. The mental health establishment can go screw itself on a barren hilltop in the rain before I touch their snake oil or listen to the visionless chatter of men half my age. I have shot Germans in the fields of Normandy, filed twenty-six patents, married three women, survived them all, and am currently the subject of an investigation by the IRS, which has about as much chance of collecting from me as Shylock did of getting his pound of flesh. Bureaucracies have trouble thinking clearly. I, on the other hand, am perfectly lucid.\n",
      "line is: Note, for instance, how I obtained the SAAB I'm presently driving into the Los Angeles basin: a niece in Scottsdale lent it to me. Do you think she'll ever see it again? Unlikely. Of course when I borrowed it from her I had every intention of returning it and in a few days or weeks I may feel that way again, but for now forget her and her husband and three children who looked at me over the kitchen table like I was a museum piece sent to bore them. I could run circles around those kids. They're spoon-fed Ritalin and private schools and have eyes that say give me things I don't have. I wanted to read them a book on the history of the world, its migrations, plagues, and wars, but the shelves of their outsized condominium were full of ceramics and biographies of the stars. The whole thing depressed the hell out of me and I'm glad to be gone.\n",
      "line is: A week ago I left Baltimore with the idea of seeing my son, Graham. I've been thinking about him a lot recently, days we spent together in the barn at the old house, how with him as my audience ideas came quickly; I don't know when I'll get to see him again. I thought I might as well catch up with some of the other relatives along the way and planned to start at my daughter, Linda's, in Atlanta but when I arrived it turned out she'd moved. I called Graham and when he got over the shock of hearing my voice, he said Linda didn't want to see me. By the time my younger brother, Ernie, refused to do anything more than have lunch with me after I'd taken a bus all the way to Houston, I began to get the idea this episodic reunion thing might be more trouble than it was worth. Scottsdale did nothing to alter my opinion. These people seem to think they'll have another chance, that I'll be coming around again. The fact is I've completed my will, made bequests of my patent rights, and am now just composing a few notes to my biographer, who, in a few decades, when the true influence of my work becomes apparent, may need them to clarify certain issues.\n",

      "line is: • All subsequent diagnoses—and let me tell you, there have been a number—are the result of two forces, both in their way pernicious: (1) the attempt by the psychiatric establishment over the last century to redefine eccentricity as illness, and (2) the desire of members of my various families to render me docile and if possible immobile.\n",

Rain clouds couldn't make it across the bordering mountain range, and even what moisture the air could retain was greedily absorbed by the immense forests and countless forest creatures inhabiting the skirts of the mountains. As a result, the winds blowing through the forests emerged parched and dry. But for a very short time each spring, the vast amount of water released by the snowmelt on the mountains was more than even the forest could drink, and it seeped into the desert environs via underground rivers.\n",

The edge of the desert was stained a light purple by the stubby, rugged plants that were now sprouting there. The new buds, glossy and metallic, sparkled brightly with reflected sunlight. Since the vegetation further into the desert grew more slowly than that toward the edge, the boundary between the desert interior and this purplish grassland was demarcated by a glittering line formed by the young plants. The entire effect suggested a ghostly field of purple flame advancing across the sugar-white sands.\n",

Queirós is untouched by the drastic hatred of life that underlies Naturalism; he is sad rather than indignant that every human being is compromised; indeed this enables him to present his characters from several points of view, and to explore the unexpectedness of human nature.\"\n",
      "line is: JOSÉ MARIA EÇA DE QUEIRÓS was born in 1843 at Povoa de Varzim in northern Portugal, the son of a local magistrate. He studied law at Coimbra, but came of age intellectually as part of the \"generation of 1870,\" a group of writers, artists, and thinkers concerned with Portugal's future after the 1828–1834 civil war. He entered the diplomatic service before marrying and settling down to the life of a comfortable but committed satirist, dandy, raconteur, and aesthete. He served as consul in Havana, Newcastle, Bristol, and finally Paris, where he died in 1900.\n",
      "line is: His first writings—travel articles, essays, short stories—were well received by Portuguese critics. But it was his early novels, _The Sin of Father Amaro_ (1876) and _Cousin Bazilio_ (1878), cast in the naturalism of Zola and Flaubert, that won him recognition on a larger European scale. _The Maias_ (1886) confirmed his growing reputation. The voice in these novels is urbane, exact, amused, ironic; but the comedy is tempered by warm sympathy for human frailty and a poignant sense of the fragility of human happiness. His later novels, most notably _The Illustrious House of Ramires_ (1900, New Directions Paperbook 785), are set in the countryside, as Eça turned his ironic gaze from the pretentiousness and greed of fashionable society to less familiar targets: liberal reform and the idea of progress itself.\n",
      "line is: Eça's voice was never easily contained by the realism of his master, Zola. His sensitive wit found perfect foils in both fantasy and satire, making this nineteenth-century master's novels vibrant, various, and still contemporary.\n",

It is not known whence it came, nor at what date. It is not even known what title the author intended for it. It is anonymous and unknown. The author never referred to it in any letter, any conversation, any article; he never offered it to his publisher, never even mentioned it!\n",

      "line is: It came to light one evening at the beginning of the year 1924, in the now famous trunk in which my father's unpublished manuscripts had been lying for more than a quarter of a century. There were 115 loose sheets, untitled and undated, covered with his usual rapid handwriting, and, as usual, without any polishing up, any correction. From the make-up of the paper, the handwriting, its compactness, especially its subject, I was at first inclined to think that the manuscript had formed part of the broad initial plan for the 'Scenes from Portuguese Life' which would have dated the novel between 1877 and 1889. That, however, was a mere conjecture. Certainly, none of the dozen titles intended for the twelve social—or, more simply, human—studies which were to make up the 'Scenes from Portuguese Life' could reasonably be applied to it.\n",

It's kind of embarrassing how his hand touching mine conjures the memory of what a warm bath feels like, given how many years it's been since I have had one. I get the occasional \"real\" shower, using actual water, but mostly I just wipe myself down with those smelly Sani-Fresh pads once or twice a day. Wolf smells the same, though. We all do.\n",

      "line is: Like last year, the big story in 2011 continues to be the explosion in e-book sales, which have been dramatic enough, and accrued fast enough, to make some commentators speculate that e-books will eventually drive physical print books out of existence altogether. I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon, if it ever does, but the e-book revolution has been impressive nevertheless, and shows no sign of losing momentum, especially with new devices like the Kindle Fire coming on sale, and no doubt other even more sophisticated devices waiting in the wings.\n",
      "line is: According to BookStats, a joint-research venture between the Book Industry Study Group and the Association of American Publishers, e-book sales jumped to $863.7 million in 2010 from $61.8 million in 2008. No reliable overall figures for 2011 are yet available, but one publisher predicted that e-books could account for as much as 40 percent of total revenue by the end of 2012. Considering that it's been estimated that one in five U.S. adults are reading e-books on a variety of devices, from dedicated e-readers to media tablets, and that there was a major surge in e-book sales after the 2011 holiday season (all those people looking for something to read on the devices they'd gotten for Christmas presents), that could well turn out to be true. The AAP report for September 2011 shows e-book sales up 100 percent to $80.3 million. Year-to-date figures show e-books up 137.9 percent at $727.7 million. Barnes & Noble's second-quarter sales report (for the period ending October 29, 2011) shows NOOK sales (for both the devices themselves and for e-books) rising 85 percent to $220 million, \"four times what they were in the comparable period last year,\" according to CEO William Lynch.\n",
      "line is: None of this, impressive as it is, means that the print book industry has collapsed. There were still an enormous number of print books published in 2011, and many of them sold very well indeed. The U.S. Census Bureau's preliminary figures for October 2011 show estimated bookstore sales of $886 million, down 43 percent from September 2011, but down only 7 percent from October 2010 figures. For the year-to-date, sales are up 2 percent at $12.91 billion. Overall retail sales were up 1 percent from September, and up 8 percent year-to-date.\n",
      "line is: The effect of the e-book revolution can best be seen in the changes in the kinds of books that are selling best. Hardcovers and trade paperbacks both saw their numbers increase, with a noticeable boost in new titles, but the traditional mass-market paperback reprints dropped significantly, as did new mass-market titles. The fact that e-book sales are dramatically increasing at a time when mass-market paperback sales have dropped suggests that e-books are to some degree filling the market niche once occupied by mass-market print books, particularly reprint titles.\n",
      "line is: Unexpectedly, sales of print books also surged during the holiday season, with Barnes & Noble showing a 4 percent rise, the first increase in five years. This suggests that many people still find a print book to be a more satisfactory Christmas present than the gift of an e-book—something physical to wrap and put under the tree.\n",
      "line is: For this reason, and the reason that for the foreseeable future there are going to be people who just prefer a print book they can hold in their hands to an e-book that must be read from a screen, and prefer browsing at a bookstore to shopping for books online, the publishing apocalypse that some commentators seem almost to yearn for, where all the publishing houses go out of business, physical brick-and-mortar bookstores disappear completely, and print books themselves become extinct (or at least rare artifacts), is probably not going to happen—although things in the publishing world are never going to go back to the way they were before the invention of the e-book either. (Another factor not usually taken into consideration in conversations about the future of books is that even here in the twenty-first century, there are still plenty of people who don't have e-readers, don't have notebook tablets, don't have Internet access, don't even have computers of any sort, and their numbers may even swell as economic times harden. To ignore them would be to abandon a considerable subset of potential customers. Even the poorest of people may occasionally be able to afford a paperback book, where they might not be able to afford a Kindle or an iPad.)\n",
      "line is: Besides which, it doesn't really come down to a choice between print books and e-books. The most likely thing is that most customers will buy both print books and e-books, choosing one format or the other depending on the circumstances, convenience, their needs of the moment, even their whim. There are even some indications that in some cases people will buy both the e-book and print versions of the same book. The chances are fairly good that all of this will eventually lead to a general expansion of the book business in general, no matter what format the books are being sold in. More people seem to be reading more books, in whatever format, than ever before—and that can't be bad news in the long run.\n",
      "line is: One of the other big stories of 2011 was the controversial move by Amazon to found their own publishing imprint, leading to accusations of antitrust practices, the charge being that Amazon's immensely deep pockets (estimated at $40 billion in 2011) and its position as the leading online bookseller would enable it to engage in predatory pricing to destroy its retail competitors, the so-called Big Six publishing companies, by effortlessly outbidding them for bestsellers. This has led to what the Author's Guild blog has called \"a behind-the-scenes battle for control of the publishing industry,\" a three-sided battle between Amazon, the Big Six publishers, and Barnes & Noble, whose NOOK is the Kindle's rival for dominance of the e-book market.\n",

      "line is: We lived in a two-story house—the first floor was a doorless daylight basement while the elevated second floor had front and back doors accessible by fourteen-step staircases. The house was constructed by our tribe using grant money from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, more tersely known as HUD. Our family HUD house was new but only half finished when we moved in and remains unfinished, and illogically designed, over forty years later. It was worth $25,000 when it was built, and I think it's probably worth about the same now. I don't speak my tribal language, but I'm positive there are no Spokane Indian words for _real estate appreciation._\n",

My sisters, Kim and Arlene, never married and nearly fifty years old now, have never lived more than one mile apart, so perhaps they cannot escape their twinly proximity.\n",
      "line is: Also on the top floor of our HUD house is the master bedroom, where my late father slept alone, and a disproportionately large living room, where my late mother slept on a couch.\n",
      "line is: My late father, Sherman Alexie, Sr., was a Coeur d'Alene Indian. He was physically graceful and strong, adept at ballroom waltzes, powwow dancing, and basketball. And always smelled of the smoke of one good cigar intermingled with dozens of cheap stogies. As a teenager, he began to resemble the actor Charles Bronson, and that resemblance only increased with age. Introverted, depressed, he spent most of his time solving crossword puzzles while watching TV.\n",
      "line is: My late mother, Lillian Alexie, crafted legendary quilts and was one of the last fluent speakers of our tribal language. She was small, just under five feet tall when she died. And she was so beautiful and verbose and brilliant she could have played a fictional version of herself in a screwball Hollywood comedy if Hollywood had ever bothered to cast real Indians as fictional Indians.\n",
      "line is: I don't know if my parents romantically loved each other. I am positive they platonically loved each other very much.\n",

And then my mother continued to sleep alone on a living room couch—on a series of living room couches—until her death, in 2015. My parents were not a physically affectionate couple. I never saw, heard, or sensed any evidence—other than the existence of us children—that my mother and father had sex at any point during their marriage. If forced to guess at the number of times my parents had been naked and damp together, I would probably say, \"Well, they conceived four children together, so let's say they had sex three times for keeps—the twins only count for one—and four times for kicks.\"\n",
      "line is: My big brother, Arnold, and I each had our own mostly finished basement bedrooms. But he spent much of his time living and traveling with a family of cousins like they were surrogates for his parents and siblings. I love my brother, but he sometimes felt like a stranger in those early years, and I imagine he might say the same about me in our later years. Never married, but in a decade-long relationship with a white woman, he is loud and hilarious and universally beloved in our tribe.\n",

He searched for pins or medals, turned the pockets inside out, anything to tell him more about the uniform's owner. No luck, although the double bands on the cuffs indicated that it belonged to a high officer. The style looked odd, too.

They looked like they would fit him rather well—wait a second. He narrowed his eyes at his arms, then his legs, then considered his torso. When had he put on all this muscle? Not that he was complaining, exactly, but the last he'd checked he'd been rather slimmer.\n",

      "line is: Most important of all is whether it is true that the confused man at the hospital did actually tell me, from the depths of his bitter weeping and without me asking, that everything in life and perhaps in death too (even though he admitted that he hadn't yet been there) is based on three fundamentals: vengeance, betrayal, and envy. I asked him what about love, and he replied, Love—only when it's betrayed or in fun. Love comes after betrayal, but with you it will come beforehand.\n",
      "line is: I thought I'd write a book quite the reverse of a laudable one and call it \"The Funniest Thing that Happened to Me in the War.\" In the end I wrote it under this other name, _1948_ , which isn't at all funny, because I truly wanted to write about the funniest thing that happened to me in the war.\n",
      "line is: Right after the conversation with the confused man at the entrance to the hospital in bombarded Jerusalem, which was an Italian monastery converted into an abattoir for soldiers, I was laid on a real bed and was flooded with pleasure, because after all those months I was lying on a sheet. My leg hurt a lot, but once I settled in I felt good, the sheet touched my back, a glass of water stood beside the bed and I drank from it, and just as I began feeling like a human being once more, there was a sudden loud noise, the ceiling collapsed from a shell that sliced through it, its hanging innards began falling like jets of snot, and two nuns hurried to me, got me onto a stretcher, and on the way to the cellar I was covered with ancient Christian plaster that continued to drizzle from the ceiling. The sister looked at me, I was half naked, and in Germanic Hebrew she said that attempting to prevail over Satan was like a spark from hell falling onto the soul's wedding dress. According to Ben-Azzai—that's what she said, I remember!—according to Ben-Azzai, \"My soul thirsts for Torah, and the preservation of the world is in the hands of others.\"\n",
      "line is: There was a connection there. I was young. She was young. I was half naked. She was dressed as a nun. But she had decided to be a virgin whereas I was forced to be one, and she, I don't remember why, went on to say that the doctors are playing God! I evidently do remember, because it's impossible to remember the terrible pain, but I remember that it hurt. The nuns put me down, covered in dust, this time onto a mattress without a sheet. For some reason I laughed, and one of the nuns—who because it is said that there is no humor in heaven had never heard laughter, and didn't know exactly what this sound coming from me was, and why my face had suddenly opened—cleaned me up thoroughly and asked what I was thinking when I turned up my mouth like that. She spoke Hebrew quite fluently, and I replied that I just, I don't think, I just do it. She said, But you look like someone who knows how to think, and I told her that maybe I'd try thinking, and she said, You know, you're a sweet man. And then she stopped short because she didn't know what to say to an eighteen-year-old boy about to have a leg amputated. I told her that what made me laugh was that only now, when I wouldn't be fighting anymore, I realized that I had no idea in which war I'd been fighting and what exactly had happened to me in that war and why I'd carried on fighting when the chances of my getting back home were nil. I told her I understand that I don't exactly know who I am. That I don't know what I'm doing and don't know where I've been. After she laid me down on the stinking mattress in the cellar that was gradually filling up with the wounded, she ran into the corridor to fetch somebody else.\n",
      "line is: Throughout the days of the fighting I didn't think. I didn't make plans. I did what I was told and took initiative only when there was no choice and we had to improvise. I was told to sleep, I slept. I was told to get up, I got up. They gave out food, I ate. When they didn't, I wasn't hungry. It was evidently true that they put sodium bicarbonate in the small quantity of water we were given to drink because I didn't think about girls, who a year earlier had devoured me with their budding femininity. I remembered that there had been absolutely nothing inside my battered skull. We were like kids, so shamefully young, volunteers, we were boors, partisans. Except for me there weren't any youngsters who had previously worked in youth movements—they would be called up later, after we'd finished establishing a state for them. We were just one from here and another from there, we still had no documents whatsoever, except for Palestinian birth certificates, which of course we didn't carry with us. So why had I remained in that parched hole and why hadn't I gone home while the siege had not yet been tightened? Why hadn't I gone home? After all, nobody would have known what had happened to me and anyway, there was no time to think, and they would surely have assumed I'd been captured by the Jordanians or died and been buried in a forlorn grave \"known only to God,\" the way the gravestones were inscribed in the field of the dead in Trumpeldor Street in Tel Aviv, and perhaps they'd find my body if I had indeed died someplace where no one imagined I'd be.\n",
      "line is: I was a fool who'd gone off to be a valiant soldier and smite the enemy. That's what I was. Had I enlisted so early, at seventeen and a half, because I was a hero or was it because I was scared and had run away from something? And if so, from what? I was evidently a coward. People with creative imaginations also possess this ability to be fools who volunteer for lost causes. I emerged from my dread as a hero who had overcome his fears. And beforehand I'd been a bundle of fears. Of death. Of the dark. Of people. Of crowds. Of disease-bearing flies, of Anopheles mosquitoes that carry malaria, about which my mother, Sarah, would speak as a woman who'd been personally acquainted with them in her youth in Palestine. I wasn't a courageous hero like many of the troops. I was somebody who didn't give up. Somebody who, although frightened, saw death and did not flinch. I knew that aboard the small ships at sea there were thousands of homeless Holocaust survivors unwanted by any country, and I'd read that three years earlier Herr Goebbels had said that if the Jews were so clever and so talented, and played so beautifully, how was it that no country wanted them, and I remember it sticking in my craw and I wanted to take part in bringing those Jews here.\n",
      "line is: Was that truly the real reason I enlisted in November 1947, a short time before the United Nations resolution on the partition of Palestine? What I do remember is that one day, in the first semester in twelfth grade at the Tichon Hadash High School, which was the most wonderful place to be, with its stirring principal, Tony Halle, who looked like a magnificent mouse and one day stood on a chair and closed her eyes, with tears oozing from beneath their lids, and with a kind of profound yearning began describing how, in 1077, Heinrich IV stood facing the fortress of Canossa, where Pope Gregory VII was hiding behind a curtain, and how poor Heinrich stood there in the cold, the snow, in a desolate land, how he stood there barefoot, she said with her deep beauty, how he stood without shoes, without socks, without a coat, without a shirt, without underpants, and wept before the pope, who was hiding in warm clothing, and behind him a blazing hearth, and he looked and saw the handsome, heroic Heinrich IV, the magnificent and beloved king, his true love, freezing naked and pleading for his life, and all of us, the whole class, wept at hearing about the fate of Heinrich IV, and one day, just like that, I left that sweet school with an adage that even I didn't believe, that we wouldn't drive the British out with cube roots, and I volunteered for the Palyam* because I said I'd bring the survivors to our country's shores and didn't really think about where the boats carrying them would come to. Right after our sea training we went off to fight in the Jerusalem and Judean hills. So I'd said I'd enlisted to bring Jews, so what? Did I really think that the boats would reach the Port of Jerusalem that's buried alive between the desert and the green landscape and Bab el-Wad*? And even before that, our absurd teachers had gone on at us and stuffed our minds with building and being built in the Land of Israel, but we didn't really understand what it meant. After all, we were born here. With the thistles. With the jackals. With the carts harnessed to blinkered mules, and the prickly pears, and the pomegranates, and the cypresses with their beautiful foliage, so how do you actually build and be built?\n",
      "line is: Here and there one heard talk of a Jewish state. The concept of \"state\" didn't ring true, it didn't sound real, since when, after two thousand years, had our people had a state? And what kind of a state would it be? What would this little state be like? Liechtenstein, the Congo? And what, would Ben-Gurion wear a top hat and stand on a box like Herzl on the balcony in Basel so as to look tall? And would a Jewish policeman blow a whistle or a shofar, a ritual ram's horn?\n",
      "line is: In an old volume hidden behind my father's German books—highlighted in red ink and written in the cursive Rashi script he liked to use with that latent spark of a Galician Jew who thought he'd been born in Berlin and who sometimes sang Jewish prayers between Schubert and Brahms lieder—I found the story about the Rabbi of Ladi who fought a historic battle with the Rabbi of Konitz over the possible conquest of Moscow by Napoleon. They had to decide, once and for all, whether or not this conquest was good for the Jews, and since the fate of the Jews was about to be sealed, the vigorous Rabbi of Ladi, who was so concerned by the magnitude of the task that tears flowed from his eyes, summoned the Rabbi of Konitz to the synagogue to decide what would be good for the Jews. Something happened, the Rabbi of Ladi was somewhat late and the Rabbi of Konitz got there before him, took his shofar and started to blow it, and the Rabbi of Ladi ran inside, snatched the shofar from his hands together with the blast from the Rabbi of Konitz's shofar, and that's what caused Napoleon's defeat at Moscow and decided the fate of the Jews.\n",
      "line is: That's what happened to us. We went off to bring Jews by sea and ended up establishing a state in the Jerusalem hills. It's a mistake to think that we fought for the establishment of this state. How were we to know how you establish a state? Had anybody done it before us? Nonsense, a Jewish state was the blast snatched from the shofar of others, and yes, somehow with the power of a miracle that was actually the act, the sound of the shofar reached its destination. For when the Palmach* took Safed (I wasn't there), the town's rabbi said that Safed had been saved by a miracle and deeds: the deeds were prayers and the miracle was that the Palmach arrived. We were charged with miracle making. A state was a vague, even ridiculous notion. The first thing we know about the history of our people was the patriarch Abram fleeing from his homeland because he heard God, not Moses's god but another Canaanite god, say to him, Get thee out of thy country! So how could we know what love of country is? And of all the peoples in the world that didn't think of fleeing from their homeland for two thousand years, we should suddenly become a people that loves a land of its own, that isn't its own, and establish a state in it? We're a people of suitcases, of wandering, of yearning for a place we were never in. Abram comes and finds famine in the land of his dreams and right away goes down to Egypt to sojourn there and returns after a long time, the way an American Israeli of today returns with great wealth from California, for the God of the Hebrews got tired of creating worlds and decided to create a new Hebrew world and started it in heaven and only later it came to Earth, since states do not dwell in heaven. So we'll build a state of nomads? We—the serfs of the Almighty, whom we despised, for whom \"Abroad\" was the name of some country, and we only knew about real countries from our stamp collections, and for us, because of the stamps' size and beauty, Luxembourg was bigger than the United States, and if we'd learned anything about countries we'd learned how to aspire to one but not how to establish it, especially if it were to be created in a hostile region like ours—we would establish it? But what did they say back then when they wanted to play with words? _Ha-ikar, bat ha-ikar. Beikar kesheha-ikar eino babayit_. (The main thing is the farmer's daughter. Especially when the farmer's not home.)\n",

      "line is: Andrei was woken by the usual morning noises: cheerful conversation in the toilet line, which already filled the corridor, the desperate crying of a child behind the thin partition wall, and his neighbor's snoring. For several minutes he attempted to struggle against the onset of day, but then the radio came on and began playing music that sounded like it was being poured into the atmosphere from a huge saucepan by some gigantic cook.\n",

Judging from the energetic heaving of his shoulders and backside under the sheet marked with blue triangular stamps, he intended to spend at least another hour in the embrace of sleep. Petr Sergeievich was clearly impervious to Guna Tamas's morningtime greetings and the voices in the corridor, but his invisible armor was no help to anyone else, and for Andrei the new day had irrevocably begun.\n",
      "line is: Dressing quickly and drinking down a few mouthfuls of cold tea, he jerked his towel embroidered with a double-headed cock off its hook, picked up the plastic tote bag holding his toiletries, and went out into the corridor. The last person in the toilet line was a bearded Caucasian by the name of Abel—today for some reason his face didn't have its usual affable expression, and even the toothbrush protruding from his fist seemed like a short dagger.\n",

      "line is: When the heavy door with the deeply scratched graffiti—\"Locomotive are Champs\"—and the filthy little window clicked shut behind him, he remembered he'd run out of cigarettes the day before. Fortunately, just behind the door he saw a tumbler-gambler, sitting in the middle of a small group of people. He bummed a \"Mainline\" from one of them and watched.\n",
      "line is: The tumbler-gambler was so old and wrinkled, he looked like a half-dead monkey, and an empty beer can for alms would have suited him far better than the three small plastic cups that he moved slowly around a piece of cardboard. Perhaps he was a guru and teacher—his large assistants were certainly very impressive and physically well-endowed: there were two of them, dressed in identical reddish-colored jackets made by Chinese political prisoners from poor quality leather. They argued all too convincingly with each other, pushed each other in the chest and took turns at winning new fifty thousand ruble notes from the tumbler-gambler, who handed them over without saying a word or even looking up.\n",
      "line is: Andrei moved away and leaned against the wall by the window. The radio had guessed right—it really was a sunny day. As the tumbler-gambler raised his head and his bald patch gleamed in the slanting yellow rays, for a moment his remaining tufts of grey hair were transformed into a glowing halo, and the complex passes he made above the sheet of cardboard seemed like a ritual of some forgotten religion.\n",

      "line is: Marjah, Afghanistan. Marines only half-jokingly compare it to the surface of the moon. There are signs of life—the landscape and villages are interwoven with lush agricultural fields, tree lines, and irrigation canals—but other parts are bleak, rocky, and dusty. One of the first things you notice about the place is the dust. It consumes you. From the ground to the air, from your gear to your throat, the dust takes over. With every step, a little cloud of dust puffs up under your boot, no matter how hard-packed the ground is. By 2010, after nine years of a U.S. presence in Afghanistan, the ground at the major bases was about as hard-packed as could be.\n",
      "line is: The temperature is somehow more dramatic than you expect. It's hotter in summer than you imagined was possible, and it's colder in winter than you are prepared for. The temperature extremes are more evident at night. In September you have to drink a bottle or two of water before bed to make up for what you're going to sweat out in your sleep, but by the start of November, your cold-weather gear can't keep the frigidness from creeping into your feet during night watches, to the point that movement becomes slow and difficult. For a U.S. Marine in Afghanistan, you might as well be on the moon.\n",
      "line is: By November 2010, the 2nd Battalion 9th Marines, or \"2/9,\" had been in the country for four months. I had enlisted not quite two years earlier, at the very end of 2008, just as U.S. and allied joint operations were ramping up. Many of the Marines in 2/9 had joined around that time, too, and for most of us, this was our first combat deployment. We were physically trained, mentally hardened, and in a naive way, excited. We had all gone into the military with our eyes open. We knew we would almost certainly be inserted into an active war zone—but it's impossible to ever be fully prepared for it. As a small-town Southern kid just a month past my twenty-first birthday, the situation in Afghanistan represented everything I believed in and nothing I had expected. I had grown up saying the Pledge of Allegiance every day in school and believing that \"liberty and justice _for all_ \" was an ideal worth fighting for. To me, it meant rooting out the bad guys who had killed almost three thousand people from ninety countries—people of every race, religion, and ethnicity—on September 11, 2001, as well as, hopefully, ending the brutal Taliban rule that had oppressed and killed so many Afghan people.\n",
      "line is: We had hydration packs to combat the extreme heat, and cold-weather gear to try to conserve what heat we could at night. We were issued phrase books to help us engage in basic communication with the locals, and try to understand their customs. But as thoroughly as the Marine Corps had prepared us tactically, the culture shock was overwhelming; we'd been transported into a world of mud homes and villages that went back hundreds of years, dominated by ways of life that probably went back thousands.\n",
      "line is: If I had to summarize Marjah in one word, it would be \"harsh.\" There is a harshness to the land, to the climate, to the way of life . . . and to some of the people. Like the guys who had been throwing grenades at us for the past two days. Then again, that may not be fair; some of the guys who placed IEDs (improvised explosive devices) or shot at us only did it because the Taliban threatened to kill their family if they didn't . . . but I guess that kind of proves my point. Afghanistan is harsh.\n",
      "line is: The grenades were actually a new thing for us; up to that point, the Taliban had mostly sent bullets in our direction, and the occasional rocket. Grenades are tricky because for them to be effective you have to be in pretty close proximity to your target—no farther away than you can throw. Thankfully most of the bad guys we'd encountered so far had seemed to want to keep their distance. But we were in a new compound now, having taken it on November 19, and the setup was not exactly what we would have chosen.\n",
      "line is: There were terrible blind spots in our position, which allowed bad guys to get much closer to us than they would have normally attempted. But up until the grenades started, I hardly even noticed the noise of them shooting at us anymore. There were certain sounds I never would have imagined that I could tune out, like AK-47s being shot at me with the intent to kill, but at some point, your brain starts registering certain input as more of a nuisance than a threat. Besides, bullets were not our main concern. We were focused on avoiding the IEDs that were stretched across roadways and walking paths and inside of walls. They had taken quite a toll on 2/9. On September 30, Lance Corporal Timothy M. Jackson had been killed by an IED. Then in mid-November, IEDs had taken out two more of our guys. By the end of our seven-month deployment, we'd lost almost two dozen men—amazing Marines and sailors, all of them.\n",
      "line is: One of those remarkable Marines was our squad leader, Zach Stinson, who stepped on an IED that had been placed underground near a wall that separated two villages. The scariest thing about an IED is that, without a metal detector, a well-placed one can be almost impossible to spot, even in broad daylight. You're lucky if the person who placed the IED is inexperienced or lazy because they will leave red flags, like disturbed dirt or a small trash pile that looks like it might have been constructed to hide something.\n",
      "line is: On November 9, at about 1:00 P.M., we were walking on patrol through one of the dried-up irrigation canals that crisscrossed the landscape. We were scanning the terrain for Taliban and making our way toward the next town we needed to secure—when another dreaded explosion went off.\n",
      "line is: The shock wave of the blast rippled through our patrol.\n",
      "line is: I was the fourth man in the patrol. The cloud of dust engulfed me as the debris rained down. The stomach-wrenching curiosity of who had been hit began to sink in. It took a few seconds to locate Stinson because he had been blown about fifteen feet and was on the other side of the wall of the canal. We found him folded in half like a lawn chair. His one remaining foot was up by his head and his legs were mangled.\n",

      "line is: A scene that's permanently etched in my brain opens in 1967 in the kitchen of a house in a new subdivision of a small farming town called Bluffton, Indiana. Our family has recently moved here from Corning, New York. There are empty moving boxes everywhere, a new playground for hide-and-seek. I crawl into one of the boxes, which easily fits my wiry seven-year-old body. I'm secretly watching my mother, who's standing across the room, looking out the window with a cup of coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other. She seems to be in a trance, and big tears are sliding down her face like swollen raindrops. She's whispering prayers as she often does when she's alone. I'm confused. At this age, I don't think moms are supposed to cry. She's probably figured out that I've been secretly pinching my little brother Nick and stealing his toys. I'm sick of him being Mr. Goody Two-shoes. I stare at my mother helplessly, mesmerized by the smoke from her cigarette as its ash grows longer. I know that it's my job to make her happy. I'm going to be perfect.\n",
      "line is: Today, as I stand at my own window with a cup of tea in my hand, gazing out at the beautiful, mature trees outside, I wish I could tell my mother that I understand her connection with trees. I realize now, that on that morning, Mom was doing her own form of yoga. She was practicing drishti (a soft-focused yoga gaze) out the window toward the memory of her cherished trees. She was calming herself by filling and emptying her lungs, which is like pranayama (yogic breathing exercises), except hers, unfortunately, involved a cigarette. She was repeating her own quiet prayer over and over. In yoga, we call this a mantra. Gaze, breath work, and mantra are ways to calm the mind in preparation for meditation. Mom's tears represented her open heart, her willingness to feel and sit with her sadness, rather than mask it. Damn, my mom was a yogi. Who knew? I'd thought yoga was my discovery, quite separate from anything she taught me.\n",
      "line is: \"Famiglia!\" my dad would say in his fake Italian accent. \"Famiglia is the most important thing in life. You always do what needs to be done for family.\" The Zello roots were in Corning, New York, where my dad, Nick, was a foreman on the swing shift at the Corning Glass Works factory. It was a grueling schedule. One week he would be on the 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. shift, the next week it was 4:00 p.m. to midnight, and the following week was the dreaded midnight to 8:00 a.m. shift, with only a day off in between. His work schedule wreaked havoc on our family life. We were always being shushed so that we wouldn't wake Dad. The days that he was able to be at the supper table with us were our happiest. Mom and Dad wanted more than anything in the world for Dad to work a regular shift so that we could spend time together as a family.\n",
      "line is: The Zello family, circa 1972: (back row, from left) Dad, Peggy, Mom, Mark; (front row, from left) me (holding our dog, Poco), Ed, Nick, John, and Joe.\n",
      "line is: One day, Dad and Mom gathered us kids together in the living room. At the time, there were five of us: Mark, Joe, Peg, me, and Nick, in that order. Mark was fourteen, and the rest of us fell into line at approximately two-year intervals. \"Guess what?\" Dad announced. \"We're moving to Indiana. I'm going to work in another Corning plant there. I'm going to work real hours, like other dads—nine to five!\" My seven-year-old mind responded, \"Oh, good! We'll be able to play during the day without Dad coming out of his bedroom yelling at us for waking him up.\"\n",
      "line is: We younger kids had no idea what \"moving\" meant, but Mark and Joe understood, and they were pissed. Today, Joe says that leaving Corning was like being dragged from a warm sleeping bag and tossed naked into a snowbank, shocking his system into angry self-defense.\n",
      "line is: The move would take us away from our beloved hometown, where famiglia and community were everything. In Corning, we lived across the street from St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church and School. Our lives and Corning's Italian/Irish community revolved around St. Vincent's. When the bells pealed on Sunday, hundreds of people would surge through the big oak doors. When Mass was over, the doors would swing open again, and everyone would spill out, dressed in their Sunday best, joking and exchanging news. My brothers were altar boys (which I was jealous of) and sold newspapers after Mass.\n",
      "line is: I was a child of the Church. When I was young, I told everyone I was going to be a nun when I grew up, just like my first-grade teacher Sister Cormac. Every Halloween I would dress up as a nun. One year, my brother Joe told me that I should put a pillow under my habit and be a pregnant nun. I didn't see why not, and couldn't understand why everyone laughed at me.\n",
      "line is: My mother went to Mass almost every day and never missed confession. She always had a rosary in one hand and a cigarette in the other. I was convinced she had a direct line to Virgin Mother Mary. If Mom hadn't always been pregnant, I would have said that she was the reincarnation of Mary.\n",
      "line is: Eventually, I became disillusioned with the Catholic Church. I was brought up to believe that priests were representatives of Jesus Christ; when charges of pedophilia became rampant, I was profoundly disheartened. I also saw that the underlying doctrine, which holds that we're all sinners meant to suffer and ask for redemption, had tormented my mother and she became riddled with guilt.\n",

IT WAS A CLEAR AND EYEBLUE DAY, THAT DAY, AS WAS THE FIRST DAY OF THIS STORY, A FEW YEARS AGO IN JANUARY, ON CHICAGO'S NORTH SIDE, IN THE OPULENT SHADOW OF WRIGLEY AND WITH THE WIND COMING LOW AND SEARCHING OFF THE JAGGED HALF-FROZEN LAKE. I WAS INSIDE, VERY WARM, WALKING FROM DOOR TO DOOR.\n",
      "line is: I was talking to Hand, one of my two best friends, the one still alive, and we were planning to leave. At this point there were good days, good weeks, when we pretended that it was acceptable that Jack had lived at all, that his life had been, in its truncated way, complete. This wasn't one of those days. I was pacing and Hand knew I was pacing and knew what it meant. I paced like this when figuring or planning, and rolled my knuckles, and snapped my fingers softly and without rhythm, and walked from the western edge of the apartment, where I would lock and unlock the front door, and then east, to the back deck's glass sliding door, which I opened quickly, thrust my head through and shut again. Hand could hear the quiet roar of the door moving back and forth on its rail, but said nothing. The air was arctic and it was Friday afternoon and I was home, in the new blue flannel pajama pants I wore most days then, indoors or out. A stupid and nervous bird the color of feces fluttered to the feeder over the deck and ate the ugly mixed seeds I'd put in there for no reason and lately regretted—these birds would die in days and I didn't want to watch their flight or demise. This building warmed itself without regularity or equitable distribution to its corners, and my apartment, on the rear left upper edge, got its heat rarely and in bursts. Jack was twenty-six and died five months before and now Hand and I would leave for a while. I had my ass beaten two weeks ago by three shadows in a storage unit in Oconomowoc—it had nothing to do with Jack or anything else, really, or maybe it did, maybe it was distantly Jack's fault and immediately Hand's—and we had to leave for a while. I had scabs on my face and back and a rough pear-shaped bump on the crown of my head and I had this money that had to be disseminated and so Hand and I would leave. My head was a condemned church with a ceiling of bats but I swung from this dark mood to euphoria when I thought about leaving.\n",

      "line is: There had been a nasty incident, half-way between France and England, when young Adolf, turning in a moment of weakness to take a last look at the hills of Boulogne, had come face to face with a man wearing a beard and thick spectacles. For several seconds the two strangers had stood on the wind-swept deck and stared at one another. I shall control myself, thought Adolf. I will not run. Accordingly he had strolled in a leisurely fashion away from the stranger until, arriving at a convenient flight of stairs, he had bolted below deck and locked himself in the gentlemen's lavatory.\n",
      "line is: There for some time he had studied his passport and his papers, made out in the name of Edwin, his dead brother, and wondered miserably if it was likely that the Austrian military authorities would detail an official to shadow him across Europe. It was odd that they had known he would be on this particular steamer. Was it possible that his half-sister Angela had reported him to the police? She had been in a morbid frame of mind when he visited her in Linz; her conversation had centred mainly on the last painful moments of her husband, the tax inspector, and the present state of his grave: some sort of animal was disturbing the top soil. Her fingernails, Adolf noticed, had constantly raked the smooth surface of the tablecloth. She had smiled once in four hours – when reading aloud part of the seven-page letter recently arrived from England. Misunderstanding that smile, he had been foolish enough to laugh openly at the mention of safety razors. It was then that Angela had rounded on him, implying that he too lacked business ability and was in no position to criticise anybody. He had left abruptly, but not before pocketing the money she had placed ready for him on the dresser. It was true that on several previous occasions he had been forced to accept small sums from her, but in a sense he was merely borrowing money that had belonged to him in the first place. Perhaps it was not his sister but the lamplighter, Josef Greiner, who had betrayed him – that so-called friend who only two days ago had cut his hair for nothing. Had there not been something sinister in the way Greiner – a man often to be found rolling in the gutter – had fastidiously spread newspaper on the linoleum floor of the Männerheim lounge?\n",
      "line is: At last, maddened by doubt and repeated blows on the panelling of the door, Adolf had flung back the catch and run savagely up the companionway to confront his pursuer. He would not hide like a fox in a hole. He had run with such swiftness that the wind had caught his cap and lifted it from his head. But though he had circled the deck for an hour or more he had been unable to find the bearded man. Nor, when he had retraced his steps and gone below in search of it, could he find his blown-away cap. Man and hat had disappeared in mid-channel.\n",
      "line is: Now young Adolf was sitting in the corner of a railway compartment, engrossed in a book. He had been reading for six hours, sometimes the same page, over and over. He read because by this time he was faint from lack of food, and because it seemed to him in his famished state that whenever he carelessly allowed himself to glance upwards from the page the numerous occupants of the carriage were eating. Their faces turned instantly to his; they made those small gestures – a slight lifting of the shoulders, a clearing of the throat – preparatory to offering him something. Even when he was careful only to look out of the window, he imagined he saw mouths reflected in the glass, steadily munching, imitating those other bedraggled beasts that cropped the grass beside the railway line. So he kept his head down as the train travelled slowly northwards beneath rain-filled skies and read and re-read the story of Old Shatterhand, chief of the white settlers of Texas and Arizona pledged to annihilate the fiendish Ogellalah Indians.\n",
      "line is: Through a landscape shimmering with heat Old Shatterhand rode like the devil himself into the encampment. Sunlight glinting off the barrel of his gun, he routed the cowardly redksins and took prisoner the warrior Nantaquond. Even now, Nantaquond lay staked out in the dust, naked as a babe; above him straddled Shatterhand holding aloft a leather pouch, from which dripped a thin trickle of wild honey that laced in golden strands the bloodstained limbs of the captive warrior – there, where his limp manhood lolled, mauve against his thigh. In the heavens of the Wild West, specks of dirt on the blue cloth of the sky, flies gathered in a quivering arrow and hummed downwards to the fallen Nantaquond. 'I am great,' hollered Old Shatterhand. 'I am glorious.'\n",
      "line is: Only at these triumphant and concluding words did Adolf put down his book. Immediately he was aware of the rumblings of his stomach. He dug his fists into his empty belly and affecting an interest in the view pressed his cheek to the window pane and squinted along the track. The train, buffeted by wind, was swaying over the steel lattice of a bridge, high above the silted estuary of a river. In the distance some kind of tower, complete with battlements, rose into the sky. From the outer wall a balcony hung, supported by winged angels carved in stone, on which a uniformed official stood as though behind a waterfall, holding a flag. Torrents of rain, spilling from the ramparts above, fell on to the red gravel of the track and sprayed the carriages ahead. Afterwards Adolf was inclined to think of his whole journey as one long approach to this dark fortress on the horizon; in reality he had no sooner caught sight of the building than it was upon him. The man in uniform, standing there like an heroic character in some opera, served no visible purpose. He had neither machinery to work, nor signal to operate; the flag he so uselessly held clung like a rag to the lapels of his braided jacket. The carriage rocked as it drew level with the tower – Adolf peered directly up at the balcony. He saw an angel, whose stone cheeks dripped with rain, and the face of the man, looking down. For an instant their eyes met. The man's mouth, set in a wild beard pulled by the wind, began to open. Then a long plume of smoke, spurting from the squat funnel of the engine ahead, floated backwards and whirled about the tower. The train passed by.\n",
      "line is: It was almost three o'clock in the afternoon. The passengers started to prepare themselves for arrival; they shook the crumbs from their clothes and kept an anxious eye on the weather. It was too soon to lift down the luggage from the rack. Adolf remained hunched in his seat, one hand shielding his face. He had the absurd idea that overhead the bearded man crouched waiting on the roof of the train, and yet he couldn't help but yawn repeatedly. It was as though he was a schoolboy again, making the journey from his home in Leonding, through just such a landscape of pale fields edged with mud, to the Realschule in Linz. Ahead of him stretched a day of unutterable boredom. In the gloomy building on the Steinstrasse he would attempt to memorise certain principles of mathematics or paragraphs of French and, failing, slump feebly over his books, listening to the squeak of chalk on the blackboard, until his eyelids closed and he felt he existed in some void between life and death, mindless, like an animal hibernating in the dark. It would be better if he never reached his destination. Spaced out across the hills stood the crumbling watch-towers, monuments to a time when Austria feared invasion by the armies of Napoleon. The rain flattened the grass that grew among the ruins and blew inwards over the flooded meadows to beat against the windows of the train. He had only to lift his head to see how the entire world wept.\n",
      "line is: While he was sleeping, the train plunged into the hills surrounding the city and entered a massive tunnel blasted from yellow sandstone. His fellow passengers hauled down their baggage and dragging open the compartment door stumbled into the corridor. Someone trod on Adolf's foot. He woke to darkness and confusion. The carriage was swaying so violently that he was forced to cling with both hands to the edge of his seat. Outside the window, a wall of rock, lit at intervals by flickering jets of gas, towered above him. Just when he thought he must be dashed to the floor, the train rumbled out of the tunnel and slid beneath a vaulted roof of iron and glass into Lime Street Station.\n",
      "line is: Hatless, his only luggage a book on Shatterhand of the Wild West, young Adolf had arrived in Liverpool.\n",

      "line is: James Herriot would love it. But then James Herriot is to blame for it. As a child growing up in the Seventies, I was addicted to his books detailing his life as a country vet in Yorkshire. Not to mention the TV series and the films.\n",
      "line is: I even wanted to be a vet; alas my quite remarkable inability to do maths prevented that so I settled my imbibed love of animals by taking up my family's usual method of employment. Farming. Well, that and writing books. And yes, I was influenced in that course too by one James Herriot.\n",
      "line is: Reading James Herriot's books as an adult I was struck by their greatness. I do mean greatness. The 'heart-warming charm' of his books sometimes beguiles as to their perfection in characterization, construction and prose. Look at _If Only They Could Talk_ or _It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet_ with a critical eye. Herriot, it can be said without exaggeration, can be mentioned in the same hallowed breath as Thackeray, Maugham or his own favourite author, P.G. Wodehouse.\n",
      "line is: It will come as a surprise to many, as it did to me, to find that James Herriot, the man who gave his name to 'Herriot Country' in North Yorkshire, was actually born in another area of the North East, Sunderland. He was then taken at a few weeks old to live in Glasgow, where he was 'bred'.\n",
      "line is: And, his real name was James Alfred Wight; James Herriot was a pen name, conjured up to avoid the problem that vets were not allowed to write books in the 1970s in their own names because this could be construed as advertising.\n",
      "line is: It is the life of Alf Wight – he was always known by his middle name – from birth until his joining the famous veterinary practice of Siegfried Farnon in Darrowby at the age of 23 that is the subject of _Young Herriot_. Specifically, how a boy from a working-class shipbuilding family in Depression-era Glasgow became both a vet and a writer. Although James Herriot did not publish a book until 1966, when he was 50 and living in Thirsk (the real Darrowby), James Herriot, as veterinarian and as author, was made in Glasgow. His accomplishments were his own, but he would have been the first to acknowledge the part his family and his adopted city played in his success; 'With love to my mother,' reads the telling inscription in _Vet in Harness_ , 'in dear old Glasgow town.'\n",
      "line is: Glasgow was also where Alf undertook his studies to become a vet. Glasgow Veterinary College in the Thirties was an eccentric institution. But Glasgow Veterinary College, like Glasgow itself, did something right: the two most successful veterinary authors in British history both came from Glasgow, and both attended Glasgow Veterinary College. One was Alf Wight; the other was his friend Eddie Straiton, the 'TV Vet'.\n",
      "line is: James Herriot was fortunate, frankly, to train and practise as a vet when he did but all great writers are attended by a lucky star that puts them in the right place at the right time. He was witness to, and chronicler of, the very last days of an old order, in which vets did not yet have antibiotics and their farmer clients were not yet agri-businessmen. A pre-deluge society where the vet trailed an aura of black magic as he (and it was almost overwhelmingly he) arrived on small farms that seemed to grow, along with assorted livestock, colourful characters as a matter of course.\n",
      "line is: Antibiotics, in the shape of the sulphonamides, were discovered in a series of quiet experiments by Germany's IG Farben company in 1932. It is impossible to overestimate the impact of IG Farben's patented antimicrobial drugs. Vets went from making up colourful potions (frequently of dubious efficaciousness) to injecting colourless antibiotics of near miraculous nature. Within just ten years of Alf Wight leaving Glasgow Veterinary College in 1939, antibiotics had taken over, as Ken Mitchell who went to Edinburgh in 1944 to study veterinary science, discovered:\n",
      "line is: _When I was a student I lived in a hostel with a lot of medical students. I was given penicillin, which was a trial drug, by them because I had laryngitis. By the time I had finished my course in 1949–50, antibiotics had become available not only in the human field but in the animal field as well and were starting to become well established in farm practise. You could now do surgery on the farm safely, for instance, and surgical operations such as caesarean sections became very common because you could use antibiotics to follow up and prevent infection_.\n",

      "line is: He realized this in a coffee shop three blocks from the townhouse where he and his girlfriend, Allison, lived, sitting in a stuffed chair with his back to the front window. It was early on a weekday morning; all of central Ohio had woken to four inches of new snow, and Mark and Allie had decided to take a morning walk, ending here. Just before rush hour, the Cup O'Joe was full, noisy, the air warm and humid from snow melting off scores of boots. Allison had left Mark alone to use the restroom, and he was pretending to read the _Dispatch_ while he waited. And then came the prickle at his neck, the sudden shock—as though a sly lover had drawn the tip of a fingernail across the short hairs of his nape.\n",
      "line is: He lifted his eyes from the paper and scanned the shop, but no one was looking his way. Then he turned around in his seat and was startled again: A woman—a stranger—was peering through the window at him.\n",
      "line is: The woman was older than he was, forty-five maybe. Her face was round, unnaturally tan for December, and wrapped in a silver scarf; what hair escaped was curly and very dark. Her eyes were wide: she seemed surprised to see him, in a way he recognized, and that soured his stomach.\n",

Or she could simply be a crazy; Columbus had its share. Still, her appearance and departure left Mark oddly shaken, maybe because the strange woman was of a piece with a morning that had already done its best to unnerve him.\n",

Together we discussed all the topics broached here. Concurrently Ellen became a yoga teacher as well as a doctoral candidate, completing a thesis on the _Bhagavad Gita_. Matthew Dasti and Neil Dalal, also graduate students at Texas, made helpful comments, as did my philosophy colleague and fellow yoga student Kathleen Higgins. Matthew helped me select passages from the _Gita_ to translate in appendix B. Insights and lots of feedback were provided by my wife, Hope. Kisor Chakrabarti, J. N. Mohanty, and Peter Heehs read portions of early drafts and made solid suggestions. For chapter 2, , and , the book has benefited from extensive comments by Colin Foote, particularly with regard to Buddhist theories and practices.\n",

Tracie Brace, founder of Yoga Rasa, Houston, and Michael Benton (\"Mehtab\") and friends at Yogayoga, Austin, graciously rewarded a little teaching of Sanskrit on my part by enriching my practice through help as teachers or students, as did dozens more, all of whom I salute with heartfelt thanks.\n",

In India, traditions of yoga practice include or overlap with Vedantic, Jaina, Buddhist, Sikh, Vaishnavite, and Shaivite teachings. These are multidimensional complexes of ideas and culture, and are in large part the origins of yoga training programs that have spread all over the world.\n",
      "line is: There is, for example, the invocation, dedication, or other ritual beginning of a typical yoga class. This can be as simple as a single out-breath of the chant _om_ , which is a mantra or sacred syllable according to very old Upanishads. Upanishads are \"secret teachings\" composed in Sanskrit, which was the lingua franca of ancient and classical India. Upanishads are the oldest texts in which the word _yoga_ is used in our sense, our anglicized \"yoga\" (some earlier usages carry a different meaning). The meaning and symbolism of _om_ is laid out very early in the _Mandukya Upanishad_ (c. 500 B.C.E.) and elsewhere: \" _Om_ —this syllable is all this (universe)\" and so on.\n",

      "line is: \"SCARFACE\" AL CAPONE was a phenomenon who first saw light of day less than one year before the dawn of the twentieth century, January 17, 1899. He was baptized Alphonsus Capone in St. Michael the Archangel Church, in NYC's borough of churches, Brooklyn. For most of his life he was called Alphonse, Big Al, or sometimes Big Fellow, by those who knew him or had occasion to address him other than by Mr. Capone. The nickname \"Scarface\" was used only behind his back, when he was out of earshot.\n",
      "line is: As a small child, Capone was brought to live in a cold-water apartment in a dwelling constructed some fifty years prior to his family moving in. The Navy Yard district where it was located was a thriving blue-collar community comprised mostly of hard-working citizens. But it had its share of wise guys, too. Capone came on the scene when industrious immigrants were not finding \"gold in the streets\" as some were led to believe, but who chased their dreams of a better life in America through back-breaking labor. A few corrupt individuals found the lure of easy money generated by the public's incessant demand for sinful pleasures too compelling to ignore, and Capone, in time, would fall in with them. It was as if fate had ordained Capone's rise to both physical and criminal maturity to coincide with the Prohibition Act of 1919.\n",
      "line is: Opportunity knocked at the door of a twenty-one-year-old hoodlum who had been tutored by mobsters Johnny Torrio and Frankie Yale. Capone's disquieting demeanor, combined with the \"technical advice\" he learned from these insidious pedagogues, contributed to the molding of the brutal Capone, whose nickname, \"Scarface,\" evoked fascination throughout the world. It is said were it not for Frank Yale, Al Capone would have never left Brooklyn. Without his primary educator, Johnny Torrio, he probably would have wound up like so many of his counterparts, just another tough guy who failed to survive what must be considered the most precarious period in the life of an ambitious \"wannabe,\" his twenties.\n",
      "line is: Years earlier, Capone's oldest brother, Vincent, had made an attempt to introduce young Alphonse to life on a grander scale than evidenced in the grimy streets, tenements, and clubhouses of their crime-infested neighborhood. Vincent's fascination with the Old West and his love of horses prompted him to bring his eight-year-old brother, Alphonse, with him on a ferry ride across a stretch of water in Brooklyn called the \"Narrows\" at the point where the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge (once the world's longest expansion bridge) now spans the bay. He shared with little Alphonse his mythical kingdom on Staten Island, which happened to be the most peaceful and pastoral terrain in the New York City area at the turn of the century. Rural and not yet victimized by overcrowding or heavy industry, Staten Island was home to a large stable of horses engaged by a company to pull wagons loaded with blocks of ice chopped from Clove Lake. This provided refrigeration for the folks on Staten Island before electricity. Vincent Capone had befriended a stable groom who allowed the brothers an occasional romp through the meadows and hills of the island.\n",
      "line is: When he was around fifteen years of age, Vincent decided to submit to Horace Greeley's edict to \"go West, young man\" and embarked on an adventure of his own. A family friend drove a melancholy young Alphonse by buggy to the Brooklyn shore, where he watched Vincent board the ferry for the last time.\n",
      "line is: Vincent settled in Homer, Nebraska, where he assumed the surname of one of his heroes, the silent film cowboy William S. Hart, and called himself Richard Hart. He kept his new identity secret from the rest of his family for almost two decades. In a real twist of fate, Richard Hart would eventually join the forces of good by becoming a deputy sheriff in Nebraska and was involved in busting moonshine operations in his part of the country while his younger brother was becoming a large purveyor of illegal beer and liquor to Chicago's thirsty population.\n",
      "line is: Yale commanded an army of over one hundred armed hitmen and associates. His criminal empire became a Brooklyn super power due in great measure to his viciousness in the Italian underworld. He also was very sympathetic toward the poor in his neighborhood and became known as the \"Prince of Pals\" throughout the entire Italian underworld.\n",
      "line is: Meehan, Lovett and Lonergan commanded an army of more than one hundred armed soldiers and hitmen. They were an underworld super power and defended the Brooklyn waterfront in a five year gangland feud with the Frankie Yale mob.\n",
      "line is: \"TOMMASSO, WHERE'SA MY bacile?\" muttered the rotund, five foot, four inch tall Maria Adamo as her seventeen-year-old approached. Knowing his mother always did her wash at this time of day, the youngster figured out just what she was looking for.\n",
      "line is: \"I don't know, Mama, I haven't seen the washbasin. Maybe you left it in the yard,\" he replied, with a sheepish look on his face. He wouldn't dare let on that he'd seen one of his brothers carrying it in the hallway earlier that morning. The thirty-eight-year-old mother of five boys and two small daughters was remarkably youthful-looking despite her many childbirths, but this morning the usually patient, mild-mannered lady was more than a little agitated. She threw her arms in the air and began mumbling a repetitive round of profanity, concluding with putana diavalo (whore of the devil) as she walked outside the doorway and circled the yard once again. Maria, dressed in a loose-fitting beige dress covered with a spotless white apron that she had sewn for herself, was becoming resigned to the fact that someone had stolen her new metal washtub.\n",
      "line is: \"Im'a keep it right here, where it stay alla time,\" Maria complained, while pointing to a nail protruding from a wooden beam close to the door that led to the yard.\n",

      "line is: ELIZABETH Taylor is a shocking and disturbing writer. The ladylike middle-class image of herself that she projected during her lifetime was profoundly misleading, and encouraged her readers and some critics to regard her fiction as safe and domestic. We were all reading her too easily. Her work is full of treachery and passion, of horror and regret and foreboding, not all of it suppressed. W.H. Auden's famous lines of the 1940s, \"And the crack in the teacup opens / A lane to the land of the dead\" are apposite here, and a recurring and memorable motif in Taylor's stories is that of a carefully repaired and riveted porcelain cup, of a broken Dresden ornament. We live near the edge of disaster and are very fragile.\n",
      "line is: The stories move from the era of war damage and postwar austerity through rebuilding and reconstruction to an age of growing affluence, of coffee bars, transistor radios, motorways, and the package holiday in the sun. Taylor's sharp eye for the telling detail seems at times to be looking at objects in a museum, as though she was aware even at the time of the symbolic value and shortening tenure of now archaic female impedimenta such as corsets, dress preservers, hairpins, bath salts, skin food, and talcum powder. Talcum powder appears almost as frequently as riveted china. Even when writing within the period, she gives a sense not of timelessness but of immanent transience. In \"The Rose, the Mauve, the White,\" one of her painful tales of adolescent anxiety, she describes three girls preparing for a dance (at which one of them rightly fears she will be a wallflower) and shaking their Christmas talcum powder over one another's backs and armpits: \" 'What a lovely smell. It's so much nicer than mine,' said Frances, dredging Katie as thoroughly as if she were a fillet of fish being prepared for the frying-pan.\"\n",
      "line is: The ominous culinary image evokes with startling clarity one of those scenes which recur in Taylor's novels: the husband, returning from work, to a meal dutifully and unquestioningly prepared, sometimes at lunchtime by home help, or by a housebound wife in the evening. So many meals, so much repetition, so many hours of boredom, so many fillets of fish. So many wives, for whom the more or less superfluous home help was the only confidante.\n",
      "line is: Loneliness and boredom feature prominently in Taylor's work. \"Tall Boy\" is a heartrending story of a young West Indian in his London bedsit, but more often she describes female loneliness, endured by the many aging single or widowed women who people her world, the casualties of demography and war. Boredom is also predominantly female, as suffered by underemployed middle-class married women whose social status prevents them from finding satisfying work. She might herself have been one of the bored and lonely, had she not with great determination created for herself a successful career as a writer, drawing much inspiration from these frustrated lives and giving a voice to her neighbors—a voice they might not always have wished to recognize.\n",
      "line is: Elizabeth Taylor (a name which caused her some difficulties) was born Betty Coles in 1912 in Reading, Berkshire, some forty miles west of London along the Thames valley, and spent most of her life within the same area, in the neighboring county of Buckinghamshire, in what is now known as the commuter belt. This became her fictional territory, and the River Thames itself features, often lyrically, sometimes oppressively, in much of her work. She initially escaped from the discouraging lower-middle-class Coles family background by working as a tutor and librarian in more intellectual and bohemian circles, and in 1936 married John Taylor, whom she had met through an amateur dramatic society. He was (significantly: see the \"civic function\" title story of this volume, \"You'll Enjoy It When You Get There\") the son of a prominent local citizen, who was the owner of a successful confectionary business and at one period the mayor of High Wycombe. John followed in his father's footsteps, and Elizabeth officially became a well-dressed businessman's wife, mother, party giver, dinner party guest, and, less conventionally, though by no means secretly, a respected novelist. She also had a not-quite-secret lover, with whom she maintained a long, complex, and intimate relationship.\n",
      "line is: The material suggested by this brief outline supplied the plots, landscapes, and characters of most of her fiction, but there were surprising paradoxes in her life, some of them reflected directly, others obliquely, in her eleven novels and in her stories. The most improbable of these was her membership in the Communist Party of High Wycombe, a phrase which might seem to those who know conservative High Wycombe to be an oxymoron. She joined shortly before her marriage and was an active member, selling copies of the _Daily Worker_ in the High Street on market days. Her political sympathies, unlike those of most of her neighbors and many of her literary friends, were well to the left, although left-wing activists often seem to be treated satirically in her work. Two stories in particular embody her social and humanitarian concerns: \"Plenty Good Fiesta\" describes the visit to a middle-class English couple of a spirited little nine-year-old Basque refugee from the Spanish Civil War, and \"The Devastating Boys,\" the title story of her penultimate collection, records the summer holiday that two six-year-old \"coloured\" boys from London spend with a similar couple in the country, having been selected and sent by a charitable organization. Both stories are based on real incidents, and the latter is a subtle and risk-taking evocation of a complex relationship forged across the barriers of class and race, and of the hidden constraints within a long-lasting conventional marriage. One would not guess the biographical origin of either story, so carefully distanced is the tone, yet both betray a controlled depth of feeling.\n",
      "line is: Difficult marriages feature frequently, and one of her most remarkable and austere portraits of marital disharmony appears in \" _Gravement Endommagé_ ,\" a powerfully atmospheric description of a couple on holiday in northern France, shortly after the end of World War II. The blighted landscape reflects the desolation of their relationship, the wife, Louise, resolutely hostile and withdrawn, the husband somewhat hopelessly committed to reparation and reconstruction and another glass of Pernod. Like much of Taylor's work, it was first published in _The New Yorker_ , appearing in October 1950 after having been submitted to the editorial scrutiny of her admirer William Maxwell. He urged her to cut references to the French setting and to a Japanese concentration camp in which, in the first draft, Louise had been interned. Taylor acceded to the second prompt but not the first, which is just as well, as the landscape with its poplars and plane trees and flaking houses and drab cafés is superbly drawn. She was always good on a sense of place. In the U.K., the story appeared in 1951 in _Woman and Beauty_ , a not uncommon publishing pattern for her work: a highbrow and sophisticated outlet in the U.S., a middle-range women's market in the U.K.\n",
      "line is: The Englishness of the stories appealed to Maxwell and to her American publishers at Knopf, but it also at times irritated them. Her novels were difficult to sell in the States, despite her frequent and highly paid appearances in _The New Yorker_. The social nuances, the distinctions of class as opposed to wealth, the very decor were alien. What to make of the Kensington hotels for aging gentlefolk, the roadhouses for the brash new motoring classes, the ivy-clad preparatory schools clinging to the rituals of the past, the luxurious Thameside villas, the picturesque but poky cottages in pretty villages, the gossipy tearooms, the dirty shops, the deeply and depressingly English public houses? They were quaint and authentic, yet at the same time worrying. There was something unsettling about Taylor's England. Maxwell recoiled from and declined to publish her most sinister story, \"The Fly-paper,\" suggested by the horrific Moors Murders of 1965, although it must be said that the low-key domestic tone of this tale of fatal entrapment seems also, initially, to have baffled her English publishers. Taylor's manner could be intentionally misleading.\n",
      "line is: Another of the paradoxical aspects of Taylor's life and work lies in her attitude to alcohol, to social and antisocial and solitary drinking. She clearly was well acquainted with hard drinkers, as we see in the characterization of the bored housewife Ida's gentleman-friend George Eliot in \"Shadows of the World.\" (George's embarrassment about his name surely echoes Taylor's own—\"His name was something he had to carry off.\") George makes himself all too familiar with \"what she called the cocktail cabinet,\" as they both wait for the return of Ida's husband, Leonard, who may or may not come home for dinner. \"Just one of those village things,\" remarks George, urbanely, as Ida's suspicions and jealousy intensify. (Meanwhile, in astonishing counterpoint, a cat upstairs is giving birth to kittens.) In the wickedly cruel \"Perhaps a Family Failing,\" drawn at the other end of the social spectrum, it is the public bar of the Seaferry Arms that ruins a honeymoon and probably a marriage. In the opening paragraph of \"Flesh,\" a tragic-comic celebration of elderly lust, we enter the bar of a holiday hotel abroad, where Phyl is enjoying \"what she called her _aperitif_ , and which, in reality, amounted to two hours' steady drinking.\" Here is a writer who appreciates the importance of the role of alcohol in fiction, and the subtle gradations of indulgence and addiction.\n",
      "line is: One would have thought that Taylor, respectable wife of a prominent businessman, would have been more at home with the cocktail cabinet than the public bar, but there was something about the anonymity and the possibilities of the pub that appealed to her strongly, and she relished the conversations she overheard there. Her induction into communism had released her from the social timidity and fear of the working classes that plagued most women in her position, and her vocation as a writer gave her a license to explore the louche underworld so well evoked in one of her last stories, \"Violet Hour at the Fleece.\" (She would have disliked that word, \"vocation,\" just as she recoiled from praise of her \"prose\": she deplored pretension and self-importance.)\n",
      "line is: Her solitary wanderings revealed to her neighborhoods with which housewives of her status would not in the normal course of life have been familiar: Her stories consciously document the changing face of postwar Britain. In an interview for _The Sunday Times_ (by Geoffrey Nicholson, 1968, quoted by Nicola Beauman in her biography _The Other Elizabeth Taylor_ , 2009) she said, \"I am a great walker about strange streets and love to be alone in a town I have never visited before.\" Her detachment and her curiosity combine to sharpen her perceptions of landscape, architecture, town planning, domestic interiors, parks, and public places. Her topographical range may have been comparatively restricted, but within that range her observations are extraordinarily fresh and telling.\n",

      "line is: When I was twelve, my sixth-grade English class went on a field trip to see Franco Zeffirelli's film adaptation of Shakespeare's _Romeo and Juliet_. From that moment forward I dreamed that someday I'd meet my own Juliet. I'd marry her and I would love her with the same passion and intensity as Romeo. The fact that their marriage lasted fewer than three days before they both were dead didn't seem to affect my fantasy. Even if they had lived, I don't think their relationship could have survived. Let's face it, being that emotionally aflame, sexually charged, and transcendentally eloquent every single second can really start to grate on a person's nerves. However, if I could find someone to love just a fraction of the way that Montague loved his Capulet, then marrying her would be worth it.\n",
      "line is: This proved to be a long, futile, and often pathetic search until I met Annabelle. I thought I had finally found my own gorgeous, talented, hyperarticulate Juliet. Unfortunately, much of my romanticism has been lost on Annabelle because she isn't exactly the world's most romantic person and doesn't get overly sentimental unless it's about her cat and certain cuts of beef.\n",
      "line is: In our relationship I'm the one who remembers and makes plans to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and even Valentine's Day. Given her very busy schedule and general forgetfulness, I'm lucky if Annabelle is even in town on my birthday, let alone remembers the actual date. In order to get a present from her, I have to pick out what I want (say, a vintage watch) and then buy it, bring her the receipt, and she'll reimburse me for it. This is why I was taken aback last year when Annabelle bragged about how she'd picked out the perfect Christmas present for me. She kept going on and on about how much I was going to love this gift and how she had really stepped up for me this time. Well, Christmas came and went, so sometime around March I finally asked her about the \"perfect present\" that I'd never received. She very offhandedly replied that the online company she'd ordered it from said the item was discontinued. That was as close as I've ever been to receiving a gift from Annabelle.\n",
      "line is: Basically, we have different marital needs. Annabelle craves a probing intellectual discourse of ideas with an academic who's willing to change the cat litter. I yearn for a marriage that is a romantic inspiration, a celebration of passions, and a terrific long-term opportunity to try out some really kinky _Kama Sutra_ -type stuff. If you're not married to a person who rocks your world, what's the point? Marriage must go beyond the mundane and reach for the romantic. I don't simply want a convenient shared communal experience, a way to split the bills and grocery shopping. I can take care of myself, thank you very much. I cook, clean, do my laundry, and buy my clothes. It's true that marriage does tend toward the domestic and the pragmatic, but I want to be married for what I don't have, for what is missing in my life, that is, a person who gets who I am and is a really good kisser.\n",
      "line is: Yes, people love to claim that you and your spouse must be \"best friends\" in a marriage. Maybe that's true. Annabelle and I go out to dinner, see movies, travel, play tennis, e-mail, tease and kid each other, but at the end of the day, instead of hugging or shaking hands good-bye, as I do with all my other \"best friends,\" I prefer that Annabelle sit on my face.\n",
      "line is: The only things that Annabelle and I can agree on is all the stuff we don't like: American Airlines, ourselves when we're around our parents, cloying romantic comedy movies about gorgeous wedding planners who help everyone get married but can't find a guy themselves, and when these same characters suddenly start singing and dancing to a clearly choreographed number that's somehow supposed to look spontaneous. We really hate that.\n",
      "line is: Yet my love for her is like a pilot light that refuses to dim. I love the way she smells, laughs, and the cute little sounds she makes when I snug-up next to her in bed at night. There is something about her that turns me inside out and inspires me. Since we met, she has been my muse. She's my raison d'être in a life filled with chaotic uncertainty, constant insecurity, and very questionable green-lit movies. This is why I married her.\n",
      "line is: I believe that Annabelle and I, like millions of other people, are standing at a new frontier of marriage. My wife informs me that there are more than three thousand analytical-therapy-inspired self-help books that claim to shed some light on this subject. I have tried to read some of them, but only get agitated and throw them across the room. I like to think of the authors of those books as the Daniel Boones and Davy Crocketts of the new frontier of marriage. And if they are Boones and Crocketts, then you should think of Annabelle and me and our book as the Donner Party. I hope our book will serve as a happy guide for the many people traveling up the same twisting, winding, rocky slopes of marriage as they do their best to avoid the paths we have taken so they won't get stuck with us on some freezing wintry mountain pass. It's in this spirit that we want to make you laugh and perhaps even learn from our profound lack of wisdom and warped perspectives. Because when it comes to being married, Annabelle and I are the Gurus of Wrong. Enjoy!\n",

      "line is: I was not the kind of girl who dreamed of growing up, getting married, and settling down. I never played dress-up weddings. I never pushed baby dolls in carriages. I pranced around in a homemade _Star Trek_ uniform and had trolls whose hair I brushed until it stood on end, then I set them on fire and tossed them into traffic just to see them get crushed. I was that kind of girl. OK, I did have Barbies, but Babs was neither a wife nor a mother. She lived in a Malibu dream house and if the little accessories that came along with her were any clue, then it would be fair to say that she spent most of her time trying on tight-fitting polyester outfits and packing for overnight trips in teensy bags big enough to hold only tiny panties and a toothbrush. Where was she going? I didn't know, but I was happy she didn't have sweat glands and I liked her freewheeling style. I wanted to be just like her, only in thrift-shop clothing.\n",

      "line is: The year 2007 in SF was a year in which average mass market sales decreased, and bestseller sales increased—a few books sold a lot of copies and fewer copies were sold of a lot of books. Generally hardcover sales were good. The SF magazines hung on. A publisher that did a lot of edgy SF, Thunder's Mouth, closed its doors and ceased to exist, the Orbit line was launched in the U.S. by Hachette, and the military and economic news in the real world was not good.\n",
      "line is: One of SF's standard scenarios, global warming, long accepted as science by scientists, was accepted by some politicians when it was suddenly discovered that the Arctic ice cap was melting very fast and might well be disappearing. Other politicians continued to maintain that science is just a matter of opinion. Still, I suppose we could say there was progress. The last volume of Kim Stanley Robinson's major trilogy on global warming was published.\n",
      "line is: Tens of millions of computer games were sold. As the year progressed, it was announced again that the electronic book is just about to replace the printed book—we are not holding our breath until it happens, though everyone in publishing would like to be able to make more money on electronic books. The money isn't there yet. There was a World SF convention in Japan, and a conference in China.\n",
      "line is: The rhetoric of fear was invoked by politicians fairly steadily to shut off debate about freedom, individual rights, and moral and ethical responsibilites, never mind objective reality. Much government corruption was exposed in the U.S. and elsewhere, and a truly enormous amount of debt heretofore hidden was noticed by the world economy. The assumptions of the quality of daily life granted as permanent in the twentieth century were rapidly disappearing.\n",
      "line is: And a lot of SF short fiction was published in magazines, anthologies, online, in pamphlets and printed zines, and by small presses of all descriptions. Much of the best of it was concerned with how we will deal with the world of the future that has replaced the assumptions of the present (now past) we have been clinging to, progressively more uncomfortably. And as in 2006, the highest concentrations of excellence were still in the professional publications, including the regular short short stories in the great science journal, Nature; in the anthologies from the large and small presses; and in the highest paying online markets, though the small press zines and little magazines were significant contributors as well. The small press really expanded in recent years and was a major force in short fiction this past year, both in book form and in a proliferation of ambitious little magazines, in the U.S. and the rest of the world. The difference in 2007 was that this was the year of the ambitious original anthology, in both fantasy and SF. Aside from the usual pretty good and partly good anthologies, there were several outstanding ones, including Fast Forward 1, The New Space Opera, Eclipse 1, and The Solaris Book of New SF.\n",
      "line is: Jim Baen's Universe and Strange Horizons remained the leading online SF publications, with Subterranean changing at the end of the year from print to online, and looking to join them at the top. And Aeon, Revolution SF, Eidolon online, Fantastic Magnitude, Clarkesworld, and Challenging Destiny, for instance, continued to show real promise.\n",
      "line is: This is a book about what's going on now in SF. We try in each volume of this series to represent the varieties of tones and voices and attitudes that keep the genre vigorous and responsive to the changing realities out of which it emerges, in science and daily life. It is supposed to be fun to read, a special kind of fun you cannot find elsewhere. The stories that follow show, and the story notes point out, the strengths of the evolving genre in the year 2007.\n",

If we didn't, young writers would probably feel compelled to find something else, perhaps less interesting, to transgress or attack to draw attention to themselves. We have a high regard for horror, fantasy, speculative fiction, and slipstream, and postmodern literature. We (Kathryn Cramer and David G. Hartwell) edit the Year's Best Fantasy as well, a companion volume to this one—look for it if you enjoy short fantasy fiction, too. But here, we choose science fiction.\n",

It is a dark story which extrapolates on all-too-familiar social trends. Bruce Sterling singled out this story as one of the highlights of The SFWA European Hall of Fame, describing it as a \"Finnish denunciation of materialistic exploitation of children.\" James Morrow calls it \"a nightmare world of assembly-line Lolitas.\" Cutting-edge Finnish SF apparently has much to offer the world SF readership.\n",

Even though he was still just a modest chief of service at the time, he used the little influence his position afforded him to keep my detractors at bay. In those days, it was hard for a son of Bedouins to join the brotherhood of the highly educated elite without provoking a sort of reflexive disgust. The other medical school graduates in my class were wealthy young Jews who wore gold chain bracelets and parked their convertibles in the hospital lot. They looked down their noses at me and perceived each of my successes as a threat to their social standing. And so, whenever one of them pushed me too far, Ezra wouldn't even want to know who started first; he took my side as a matter of course.\n",

I've had the chance to reach millions of teens and help them face the tough things we all go through. (That's why I eventually expanded my YouTube offerings to include advice on life and faith.)\n",

      "line is: ... and before Kitty knew where she was, she found herself not merely under Anna's influence, but in love with her, as young girls do fall in love with older and married women...\n",
      "line is: Today I found myself strangely moved by a yoga teacher who spoke like a cross between a phone-sex operator and a poetry slam contestant. At the start of class, she asked us to pretend we were floating on a cloud. As she put it, \"You're oh-pening your heart to that cloud, you're floating, you're blossoming out and tuning in, you're evanescing, yeah, that's right, you're evanescing.\"\n",
      "line is: I briefly contemplated giving the teacher my yoga finger and walking out. I've been practicing yoga for close to a decade now, and at thirty-four I'm too old for that airy-fairy horseshit. As far as I'm concerned, floating on a cloud sounds less like a pleasant spiritual exercise and more like what you think you're doing when you're on LSD while falling out of an airplane. But I tuned out her mellifluous, yogier-than-thou voice and soon enough found myself really meditating. Of course, I was meditating on punching this yoga teacher in the face, but still.\n",
      "line is: At the end of class, she asked us to join her in a chant: _gate, gate, paragate, parasamgate_... which means, she said, her voice shedding its yogabot tones, _gone, gone, gone beyond_. She was young, a little cupcake of a yoga teacher in her black and gray yoga outfit. Maybe she was twenty-five. Maybe younger. She said her grandmother had recently passed away, and she wanted to chant for her and for all of our beloveds who had already gone beyond. In that moment, I forgave her everything, wanted to button up her sweater and give her a cup of cocoa. I chanted _gone, gone, gone beyond_ for her beloveds and for mine, and for the twenty-five-year-old I once was.\n",
      "line is: I turned twenty-five the month after September eleventh, when the stories of those who had gone beyond that day were fresh and ubiquitous. I was working three jobs to save money to move from Seattle to New York, and whether I was at the law firm, at the pub, or taking care of my grandparents' bills, the news was on, and it was all bad. So many people looking for the remains of the people they loved. So many images of the planes hitting the towers, the smoke, the ash.\n",
      "line is: I had never really been afraid of death before that year. I thought I had worked all that out by the age of seventeen, when I concluded that so long as one lives authentically, one dies without fear or regret. As a teenager, it seemed so simple: if I lived my life as my authentic self wished to live, then death would become something to be curious about; one more adventure I would experience on my own terms.\n",
      "line is: Religion was an obstacle to authenticity, I figured, especially if you were only confirming in the Catholic Church so that your mother wouldn't give you the stink-eye for the rest of your life. So, at seventeen, I told my mother I wouldn't be confirming. That Kierkegaard said each must come to faith alone, and I hadn't come to faith— _and she couldn't make me_.\n",
      "line is: This was all well and good for a teenager who secretly believed herself to be immortal, as my countless speeding tickets suggested I did. But by twenty-five the idea of death as an adventure struck me as idiotic. As callous, heartless, and, most of all, clueless. Death wasn't an adventure; it was a near and ever-present void. It was the reason my throat ached when I watched my grandfather try to get up out of his chair. It was the reason we all watched the news with our hands over our mouths.\n",
      "line is: I had recently graduated from college, having postponed my studies until I was twenty-one in order to follow my authentic self to Europe after high school. Now I was supposed to leave for New York by the following summer. Before the attack on lower Manhattan, I had been nervous about moving to New York, but now what was supposed to be a difficult but necessary rite of passage felt more like courting my own annihilation.\n",
      "line is: Everywhere I looked, I saw death. My move to New York was the death of my life in Seattle, of a life shared with my family and friends. Given the precariousness of our national security, it seemed as if moving away could mean never seeing them again. I remember wondering how long it would take me to walk home from New York should there be an apocalypse. I figured it would take a while. This worried me.\n",
      "line is: Even when I wasn't filling my head with postapocalyptic paranoid fantasies, death was out to get me. Once we got to New York, my boyfriend, Jonah, and I would move in together, and I knew what that meant. That meant marriage was coming, and after marriage, babies. And only one thing comes after babies. Death.\n",

Lately I have become morbidly aware of my penis. Once a remote region accessed indifferently for businesslike micturition, it has developed—seemingly overnight—into a gaudy Las Vegas of the body, complete with pulsing neon, star-studded floor shows, exotic animal acts, and throngs of drunken conventioneers perpetually on the prowl for depraved thrills. I walk about in a state of obsessive expectancy, ever conscious of an urgent clamor rising from my tumescent loins. Any stimulus can trigger the show—a rhythmic rumble from the radiator, the word \"titular\" in a newspaper editorial, even the smell of the old vinyl in Mr. Ferguson's Toyota.\n",
      "line is: As much as I think about sex, I can only with extreme difficulty conceive of myself actually performing the act. And here's another thing I wonder about. How could you ever look a girl in the eye after you've had your winkie up her wendell? I mean, doesn't that render normal social conversation impossible? Apparently not.\n",

As you might expect, she is extremely well informed on all the arcane rules of the road (like who has to back up when two cars meet on a one-lane mountain road). She used to keep Dad up to date as he drove along on all the motor statutes he was violating. That's one of the reasons they got divorced.\n",
      "line is: I'm not speaking to her right now. Last Monday I came back from two miserable days in my dad's custody to find she had painted my bedroom a ghastly pink. She said she had read this color was widely used in hospitals to calm mental patients. I told her I wasn't mentally ill, I was just a teenager. Meanwhile, I am now embarrassed to invite my friends over. When you're a slight, unathletic teen who reads a lot and likes Frank Sinatra, you really don't want the word to get around that you wank your winkie in a room that looks like Dolly Parton's boudoir.\n",
      "line is: **FRIDAY, July 20** — I got a headache from reading, so I thought I'd try typing for a while. I'm still using the F3 (help) key a lot. Too bad life doesn't have an F3 key. I'd press it and tell them to send over two chicks—sixteen years old and more than usually horny.\n",

But as Carly and Frampton dematerialized, I became grimly aware of how well they'd also fit into a psychotic hallucination. My distant uncle Louie blathers constantly about aliens. He's completely unhinged when he's off his meds—and they say that stuff runs in families. Meanwhile, no physical trace of my close encounter remained. There was no blinking ray gun carelessly left on a side table. No dropped Space Pesos made from strangely durable alloys that would confound scientists. My iPhone was also in perfect working order.

She finished college, became independent, and started working and making a living. Last I heard, she'd gotten married.\n",
      "line is: One of the joys of my life right now as I travel around the country is that so many of my former patients seek me out.

A gift so remarkable, you can have a normal life with only half of one.\n",

      "line is: It was in 1965 that nighttime began to stir in me a nameless dread. I am thinking now of that evening when a light rain drifted down. In my bed I lay, a child so little you could have set me there as easily as a toy. The dripping from the eaves simply called attention to the silence that surrounded me, and the steady onset of sleep was but a gradual forgetting of the rain's patter. As I glided peacefully into slumber, it was as though a secluded path had appeared before me, opening a passage between trees and shrubs. Then from far away there came the sound of a woman's anguished wails. When those hoarse cries erupted so suddenly in the still of the night, the boy that I was then shivered and quaked.\n",
      "line is: I can see myself now, a startled child, eyes wide with fear, the precise outline of my face obscured by the darkness. The woman's cries persisted. Anxiously, I expected to hear another voice, a voice that would respond to her wails, that could assuage her grief, but it never materialized. I realize now why I was gripped by such intense disquiet: it was because I waited in vain for that answering voice. Surely there is nothing more chilling than the sound of inconsolable cries on such a desolate night.\n",
      "line is: A second memory comes hot on the heels of the first: three or four white lambs trotting across the grass by the riverside, a daytime image, a way of easing the agitation evoked by the previous memory. But I find it hard to decide just where I was when this sight left its mark on me.\n",
      "line is: Several days may have passed before I seemed to hear a voice that answered the woman's cries. It was late afternoon. A storm had just passed, and dark clouds filled the sky like billows of smoke. I was sitting by the pond behind the house, and out of the damp landscape a man I did not recognize walked toward me. He was dressed completely in black and as he approached his dark clothes waved like a banner under the gloomy sky. When this image began to close in on me it brought to mind the unmistakable sound of the woman's cry. Even from far off in the distance the stranger fixed me with a piercing gaze, and he continued to stare at me as he drew nearer. Just as I was about to panic, he abruptly changed direction, mounted the path on the edge of the field, and gradually moved farther and farther away, his loose black clothes flapping loudly in the breeze. Now, when I look back on the past from an adult point of view, I always linger long on this particular moment, puzzling over why it was that I interpreted the rustling of his clothes as a response to the woman's cries in the evening drizzle.\n",
      "line is: Then there is a morning I remember, a crystal-clear morning when I was scampering along behind some village boys, over soft earth and windblown grasses. The sunshine at that moment seemed to be a matter not so much of dazzling light as a warm color daubed on our bodies. Like the lambs on the riverbank we bounded along, running for ages, or so it seemed, until we arrived outside a dilapidated temple from which enormous cobwebs caught my eye.\n",
      "line is: It must have been a little earlier that one of the village boys had come tramping over from a spot far off in the distance. I still remember that his face was drained of color and his teeth were chattering. \"There's a dead man over there,\" he said.\n",
      "line is: The body was lying beneath the cobwebs. It was the same man who had walked toward me the day before. Although I try now to recapture my feelings at that moment, the effort fails. My memory of that incident has been stripped bare of the reactions I had at the time, and all that is left is the outer shell: the associations it now carries simply reflect my current outlook. For me as a six-year-old the sudden death of a strange man could have prompted only a quiver of astonishment and would not have been the occasion for much hand-wringing. He lay faceup on the moist earth, eyes closed, with a relaxed and peaceful expression on his face. I noticed that his black clothes were stained with mud, mottled the way a country path is spotted with somber, anonymous flowers. It was the first time I had seen a dead man, and it looked to me as though he was sleeping. That must have been the extent of my reaction then: that dying was like falling asleep.\n",
      "line is: After that I dreaded the night. I saw myself standing at the entrance to the village and pictured the gathering darkness surging toward me like floodwater, engulfing me and then swallowing up everything else. I would lie in the dark for ages, not daring to fall asleep, and the silence all around simply intensified my terror. Again and again I would wrestle with sleep. My antagonist strove with all its might to seize me in its powerful grip, and I desperately resisted. I was afraid that once I fell asleep I, like the stranger, would never wake up again. But in the end I was always reduced to exhaustion, sucked helplessly into slumber. When I woke up the following morning and discovered I was still alive, the sunlight poking through the crack in the door, I was overjoyed to find that I had been spared.\n",
      "line is: When I think back to when I was six years old, one last scene comes to mind. Here again I see myself dashing along at full speed, and in my memory I relive the former glory of the boat-builders' yard in town, and the day when their first-ever concrete boat was making its way down the river into Southgate. My big brother and I were running toward the riverbank. How bright was the sunlight of those bygone days, illuminating my still-young mother, her blue-checked headscarf fluttering in the autumn breeze; my little brother was seated in her lap, his eyes wide with wonder. My father, with that penetrating laugh of his, clambered barefoot onto the ridge between the fields. But what was that tall man in the army uniform doing there? He seemed to have arrived by chance at my parents' side, like a leaf blown into a thicket.\n",
      "line is: The riverside was packed with people. My brother showed me how to squeeze through their legs, and a clamor of voices enveloped us. When we finally crawled into a spot overlooking the river, we stuck our heads out between two grown-ups' trouser legs and gazed around like a pair of turtles.\n",
      "line is: The moment of highest drama was announced by an ear-splitting din of gongs and drums and the cheers of the crowd assembled on the banks. The concrete boat was coursing toward us. Long ropes hung down its sides, with pieces of colored paper fastened to them like so many flowers blooming on a vine. A dozen young men on board were banging gongs and beating drums.\n",

      "line is: When my boss told me that we were all going to Hawaii for Thanksgiving vacation, I tried not to panic. I was nineteen years old, and my vacation experience up to that point pretty much consisted of ten-hour trips in my family's cramped station wagon to visit my cousins in Canada. You'd think I would have been turning cartwheels down Sunset Boulevard. But as enticing as an all-expenses-paid stay at a posh Hawaiian beachfront resort would sound to most people, I was realistic enough—after almost a year of nannying for one of the most powerful families in Hollywood—to know that I'd be on duty for 192 hours straight. I had counted.\n",
      "line is: One hundred and ninety-two straight hours of running after three children under the age of seven, of sharing quarters a lot more cramped than the ten-thousand-square-foot home we normally occupied, where the air was already tense. Of no room to escape the kids or their parents for one minute.\n",
      "line is: This \"vacation\" sounded worse every time I thought about it. Good thing I didn't know about the other five kids.\n",
      "line is: The night after I was informed of our upcoming adventure, I decided to be more positive. _Come on, Suzy! You could never afford to travel to_ _Hawaii on your own. This is a great opportunity to soak up some paradise_. I tried not to think about our previous \"vacations.\" Surely this would have a whole different, relaxed, tropical vibe? I called my friend and fellow nanny Mandie to tell her my news. She listened intently while I borrowed scenes from postcards and spun my perfect vision of the eight-day trip.\n",
      "line is: \"I'll be basking on white-sugar beaches, with cute cabana boys constantly serving me fruity drinks in coconut halves. After I distribute the beach toys and reapply sunscreen on the kids, I'll soak up the Polynesian splendor. Just think, hula performances under torch-lit palms... leis draped around me... luaus... lanais...\" In my dream-dappled mind, there would be grandparents, aunts, and uncles to lavish attention on the kids. The gentle spirit of the island would permeate our hearts and inner harmony would reign.\n",
      "line is: But then Mandie started laughing so hard that I was actually afraid she'd lost control of her bladder.\n",
      "line is: We both knew it was far more likely that the actual scenario would be similar to what a mutual nanny friend of ours had just undergone. Her employer, a well-known baseball player, had brought her along to the famous Pebble Beach golf course, where he was playing in a huge charity golf tournament. The event was star-studded, and she couldn't wait to rub elbows with some celebrities. But when the other baseball players' wives realized someone had brought a nanny, they all dumped their kids in her suite and headed off to the tournament unencumbered. She spent three days in a hotel room with nine—count 'em, _nine_ —kids. She never saw one moment of golf, beach, or sunshine.\n",
      "line is: I tried to be optimistic, but my spirits wavered when even getting out of the driveway became a massive undertaking. Our traveling caravan included me and my employers, Michael and Judy Ovitz; their three children (Joshua, Amanda, and Brandon); Michael's parents; his brother, Mark, and Mark's wife, Linda, and their six-year-old son; and Michael's business partner, Ron Meyer, along with Ron's date, Cyndi Garvey, and their four combined daughters. It took two stretch limos just to get the whole group to the airport. Altogether, the entourage totaled nine adults and eight children. In addition, Michael's friend Al Checchi and his wife, three kids, and nanny would be meeting us at the resort.\n",
      "line is: After we were greeted at LAX by a professional-looking woman waiting at passenger drop-off, the limo driver unloaded enough luggage to supply an army tank division. We were breezily escorted through security and down a long hall to a door marked THE CAPTAIN'S CLUB. Who knew that airlines provided these private little sanctuaries to their frequent fliers? And Creative Artists Agency, Michael's company—with his partners, staff, and clients—had probably racked up millions of such miles on the corporate American Express card. Michael waved the whole troupe over to the Captain's Club portal.\n",
      "line is: A stone-faced young woman at the desk stopped us. Airline policy was to allow the frequent flier and one guest, and she was here to enforce the rules. She was firm and implacable with a perfunctory pleasantness that was so calm it was irritating. Michael started arguing his case, but she repeated patiently that this was company policy, with no exceptions. No exceptions? Michael's face began to twitch as if a bug were trapped under his skin. The employee gave the impression of having weathered a few of these type A folks in her day. She repeated the policy clearly and identically several times. I recognized her \"broken-record technique\" from my childcare classes. But Michael wasn't six.\n",

      "line is: Being a seven-year-old actor does not make you popular; it makes you fascinating, much in the way that dissecting a frog is fascinating. It's an interest tinged with a feeling of uneasy tension. It's a look-but-don't-get-too-close kind of curiosity. It was a lot for potential friends in my Grade 3 class to wrap their minds around. There I was, sitting next to them during art period, dipping pipe cleaners in Elmer's glue, when just that morning while they were eating breakfast, I had been singing the praises of Cottonelle toilette paper through their TV. It might have been normal for me, but they found it rather disconcerting.\n",
      "line is: Mikki was the perfect confidant. She would set her thoughtful, chocolate-milk-colored eyes on me and suddenly the weird, sideways glances and confused whispers would fade into the background. Mikki was four years older than me but our age difference never seemed to pose a problem. She had a dirty grey muzzle and long fur that poked out from between her toes. Her tail was always matted with a collection of dirt, leaves, and the occasional dead ladybug. She was arthritic and deaf. A thyroid condition made her rather obese and she possessed very little control over her bodily functions. While my dog was indeed my best friend, it would be untruthful of me to omit the fact that she had very little human competition.\n",

She was cute, tall, blonde, and the earliest known representation of everything I found intimidating about women later in life. The other four kids I had seen around. They were Older Boys. They were nine-year-olds, and anyone nearing double digits was, of course, automatically and rightfully awarded a daunting level of prestige.\n",
      "line is: From the dining room window, I could see them coming. Karen's pink streamers were waving from her handlebars, trumpeting the gang's arrival. It was both thrilling and horrifying to realize that they must have been coming to my house to play; no other kids lived on my block. Clearly, they wanted to ride bikes with me. I had a bike, but riding it had proven challenging. My mother had kindly blamed my compete lack of balance and coordination on an ear surgery I had undergone half my life earlier, but since I still can't ride well, the blame likely lays with a general lack of physical grace.\n",
      "line is: Since there was little chance of becoming proficient on a bike by the time the posse reached my front door, I required an alternate strategy. I grabbed my skateboard from the hall closet. This had become my way of seeming beyond the bike. I was cooler than the bikers. I rocked a board. My skateboard deck was laminated with tie-dye blue and green swirls and had a glow-in-the-dark sticker on the underbelly that said \"SLIME-BALL\" in all capital letters. I never really understood the purpose of such a sticker but it came with the board and it made me feel tough. Nobody had a bike with a mean word on it.\n",
      "line is: The plan was in place. When they asked me to ride bikes, I would take a cool moment to consider their offer and then offhandedly say the line, \"I'd rather skate,\" while flashing my edgy sticker. They would be suitably impressed with my independent, bad-ass choice and we would ride off into the sunset on our respective modes of transportation.\n",
      "line is: BANG. BANG. BANG. They were here. Karen and The Older Boys had come for me. Trembling a little with nervousness and excitement, I adjusted my board just so, attempting to make it look casual in my arms, the mean sticker facing out.\n",
      "line is: When I opened the door, there they were, fanned out on my front step. The boys seemed to be mostly inspecting their shoelaces, but they took quick glances up at me. Karen stood in front of them, flashed a smile and flipped her hair in a way that made her suddenly look like she was seventeen. Karen pointed to my face as she addressed her gang.\n",
      "line is: \"See, I told you guys the girl from TV lived here.\"\n",
      "line is: The Older Boys took this as their cue to really examine what stood before them. One pushed his glasses up to get the clearest view possible. They squinted in scrutiny, trying to picture it, then nodded in agreement. My face did indeed match the television face. After murmuring to each other, \"That's pretty cool,\" they each handed Karen a dollar before they got on the bikes they could all ride proficiently. And they left. Without ever saying a word to me.\n",
      "line is: They had dissected their subject. They had inspected me and poked around, displaying my most tender guts. When they got their fill of the weirdness they moved on, leaving me splayed out, pinned to a board, and rejected. I told Mikki that Karen was a SLIMEBALL. She agreed by peeing on the carpet.\n",

      "line is: In late May, the annual spring fair had come to Pico Mundo, California, where I had lived all my life, on the edge of the Mojave Desert. On Friday, I borrowed Terri Stambaugh's car so that I could take Stormy to the carnival that had set up its many attractions on the fairground midway. Terri was my boss, the owner of the Pico Mundo Grille, where I worked as a fry cook twenty-four hours each week during the school year, forty hours each week during the summer.\n",
      "line is: I couldn't borrow a car from my father, because he had walked out on us years earlier. I couldn't borrow a car from my mother, because such a request would stress her. When stressed, Mother made veiled references to suicide, and sometimes she retrieved the pistol from the nightstand drawer in her bedroom, caressing its contours with more affection than she'd ever shown me. When I was a child, which was a shorter period of time for me than it was for most people, my mother sometimes implied that she might take me with her if she decided to consummate her romance with Death. My mother is beautiful, and to anyone who never lived with her, she seems to be a genteel and pleasant lady, if slightly aloof. I moved out when I turned sixteen, into a tiny apartment above a garage, which I pay for by mowing the lawn and doing general maintenance chores for my landlady.\n",

Stormy Llewellyn didn't want a pedestal. She wanted only someone who would look her straight in the eyes and always tell her the truth.\n",

      "line is: Most people leave the world when their bodies die. Some spirits linger, reluctant to cross over to the Other Side. They come to me because they know that I can see them and that I will help them if I can. Sometimes they want their murders avenged.

      "line is: First printed in the community now known as Kitchener, Ontario, in 1836, Die Gemeinschaftliche Liedersammlung is a collection of Protestant hymns compiled for the use of Ontario Mennonites. According to Harold S. Bender, it was most likely edited by farmer, teacher, preacher, and author Bishop Benjamin Eby (1785–1853). Reprinted many times since then, the book is still in use; it is, as far as I know, the exclusive hymnal used in the Old Order Mennonite meeting houses of Waterloo Region.\n",
      "line is: Hymns are, among other things, poems: they are recognized as such by at least one Old Order author, Isaac R. Horst, who, in his Lieder Sammlung Commentary, refers to the authors of these hymns as poets. The Liedersammlung may not be the first book of poems ever published in Waterloo Region, but its continuous weekly, if not more frequent, use in Waterloo Mennonite homes and meeting houses for the last 180 years may well make it the most-read book of poems ever published in the region. Its poems were not written here, but several lifetimes' worth of reading, singing, and sharing has commingled the lyrics and melodies with this region's weather, its seasons, its rhythms of labour and rest. (That said, 180 years—a long time in the span of the printed word—is an eyeblink in the span of human habitation in this area: Geoff Martin's essay \"From the Banks of the Grand\" is a salutary reminder.)\n",
      "line is: I grew up on the fringes of Waterloo Region, the child of American immigrants who brought with them their own books—not hymnals, as was the case with the Mennonite migrants to the area two centuries earlier, but secular vade mecums: the poetry of Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost, and Wallace Stevens, some of which my mother, an English teacher, knew by heart; the textbooks on mathematics and systems theory that would form the subject matter of the courses my father would teach at the University of Waterloo. Growing up in this secular household, I in some sense shared very little with the Old Order children who were my neighbours (and who, as weekly hymn-singers, must have known by heart more verse, at the age of seven, than I do now). Yet in other ways we had much in common: the landscape, the weather, the turn of the seasons. The experience of growing up and growing older. The human grapple that is our coming to terms with death and birth.\n",
      "line is: My own growing up took me away from Waterloo Region, but in the summer of 2015 I returned—as an adult, a poet—for a three-week-long artist residency. With the other artists involved, I walked and talked and spent time at various sites around the town of St Jacobs, where the residency was based. On the afternoon of a Friday in May we found ourselves uneasy visitors to the Old Order cemetery on Three Bridges Road, beside the Conestogo Meeting House. Uneasy, because we were living people\n",
      "line is: visiting the dead, and all the more so because we were outsiders here in other ways: outsiders to the Old Order Mennonite community, first and foremost; then, too—city-based artists that we now are—to the community of southern Ontario farm people with which the Mennonite community to some extent overlaps; and finally to the community of Christian faith. Some of us came from Christian families but had left the church; others, like me, were born and bred in the briar patch of secular skepticism.\n",
      "line is: The Old Order grave markers are taciturn, but, short on words they are long on numbers: the age of the deceased, whether the person recollected lived a few years or many decades, is lovingly given in years, months, and days.\n",
      "line is: Standing in the graveyard, we began to number our own days, as the hymnal admonishes (Lass mein Herz die Tage zählen): Matt Borland, 32 years, 5 months, and 12 days...; Amanda Jernigan, 36 years, 5 months, and 17 days...; Sarah Kernohan, 34 years, 10 months, and 23 days...; Colin Labadie, 31 years, 1 month, and 15 days .... Not obits, these—as I mean those ellipses to signify—but changing tallies, unfolding counts, the linear progressions of years beautifully tempered, in this tripartite accounting, by the tallies of months and days which perennially begin anew. (Where are we now? 38 years, 2 months, and 15 days, for me, as I write this.)\n",

      "line is: What I'm going to do is to write off the story of Rick Martin's life, now that it's all over, now that Rick is washed up and gone, as they say, to his rest.\n",
      "line is: There isn't much to it, in its bare outline. Rick was born in Georgia five or ten minutes before his mother died and some ten days before his father checked out and left him with his seventeen-year-old aunt and her brother. These two worked their way to Los Angeles eight years later and brought him with them; and there he grew up in the way he apparently had to go. He learned to play the piano by fooling around with pianos in churches and roadhouses—any place, in fact, where there was a piano that could be got at and fooled around with. And because he had right in his bones whatever it takes to make music, he became while he was still a kid a very good pianist. But a piano wasn't exactly right for him, and he turned to brass finally; he earned enough money to buy himself a horn. And then he learned to play a horn—a trumpet, if there's anybody here who doesn't know what kind of a horn a horn is—and that was his proper medium. He learned a lot from Art Hazard, the great negro trumpeter, but that doesn't explain what made him so good.\n",
      "line is: He played in five- and six-piece bands around Los Angeles, and one day he was discovered for what he was worth by Lee Valentine, who could scarcely believe his ears. Valentine, playing a cross-country tour of moving-picture houses, had been put on Rick's trail by Jeff Williams, the negro band leader, who had known Rick as a boy in Los Angeles and had kept him in mind as a future bright light for a good white band. Lee Valentine didn't need to be told twice; he signed Rick and took him back to New York with the band.\n",
      "line is: He was a sensation, particularly among musicians. He was such a sensation that it wasn't long until Phil Morrison, who ran the best big orchestra of the day, bought him, and then he continued to be a sensation for Mr. Morrison. He loved his work. He had something and he knew it. He never got tired, kept it up night after night, and after he got through with the night's dance he'd get together with other men from other bands who were interested in seeing how far they could go, and then he'd really play the rest of the night.\n",
      "line is: He pushed it too far. He didn't sleep and he didn't eat, because he could do so many other things. He could drink, for instance, and before he knew it he was drinking almost constantly in order to keep everything else going. It didn't work out that way, however, and he finished up his time in this life before he was thirty. He was mourned, I might add, by almost nobody except me and two negroes, Jeff Williams and Smoke Jordan. There was a woman, named Amy North, but there's no telling how she felt about it. I dare say Rick's death was regretted by musicians here and there, but it will only be a question of time until he's forgotten completely. One of these days even his records will be played out and give forth nothing but scratching under a steel needle. When that time comes Rick Martin will really be dead, dead as a door-nail, and I hate to see it happen.\n",
      "line is: That's the story, and it could never be called a grand tragic theme; it does not depict the fall of a noble person from high to low estate—Rick Martin never got anywhere near high estate, though he did make a lot of money for a while. But it is a story that has the ring of truth and an overtone or two. It is the story of a number of things—of the gap between the man's musical ability and his ability to fit it to his own life; of the difference between the demands of expression and the demands of life here below; and finally of the difference between good and bad in a native American art form—jazz music. Because there's good in this music and there's bad. There is music that is turned out sweet in hotel ballrooms and there is music that comes right out of the genuine urge and doesn't come for money.\n",
      "line is: The story ends with death. Our Mr. Martin, from the moment he began fooling around with pianos, was riding for a fall. I shouldn't have said fooling, because he wasn't fooling; he meant it. In Rick Martin's music there was, from the first, an element of self-destruction. He expected too much from it and he came to it with too great a need. And what he expected he never quite found. He might have found it in another kind of music, but he had no training or any way of coming to know another kind of music. So he stuck to jazz and to the nervous, crazy life that goes with it. And he made a good thing of it; he made an amazing thing of his own playing; he couldn't even keep pace with it himself. He was, in his way, like Tonio Kröger, Mann's inspired and bewildered poet, who 'worked not like a man who works that he may live; but as one who is bent on doing nothing but work; having no regard for himself as a human being but only as a creator.'\n",
      "line is: Now these are strong words and should surely apply much more truly to a poet like Tonio Kröger than to the man who played hot trumpet in Phil Morrison's band. But I don't think they do, and that's the thing about Rick's story that moves me. The creative urge is the creative urge, no matter where you find it. Rick did what he could do so well that I, for one, won't be likely ever to hear his name without feeling my hair rise.\n",
      "line is: But if you choose to look at it this way, you have to go easy or somebody will say you're arty. Dance music should be criticized in its own terms, and its own terms are such inbred shop-talk that no one outside the trade could understand them. How could you say what it was that Rick had and what he stood for without getting out of bounds in one way or another?\n",
      "line is: You could, of course, twist Rick's life into a fiction and write off a clear-cut commercial story about a good-looking young man who went to a good school and then, being musically inclined, went to New York and joined a big-time dance band. You could have him smoke Marihuana once or twice, just for the hell of it; and tell whom he loved and all the rest of it. He could be playing at one of the place-names of capitalism, say the Waldorf-Astoria, and between dance sets he could meet the daughter of some kind of magnate, and it would be love and our man would never have to play another night's dance music, but just lie happily married on the deck of his wife's yacht night after night for the rest of his life, which would be protected and long.\n",
      "line is: But this can't be that. This one has to be the story of a young man who, without even knowing what it was, had a talent for creating music as natural and as fluent as—oh, say Bach's. Rick Martin never would be put down to playing exactly what was written for him; he'd just sit there and fit himself into the heavy going, but when his own turn came, or whenever he saw his chance, he would take off and invent, extempore, some of the freshest, most imaginative music that ever occurred to anyone.\n",

      "line is: There's this expression that goes, \"It's a small world after all.\" Well, after a year tramping across the globe by plane, train, bus, boat, foot, and thumb, let me just say that it is, in fact, a very large world. To give you an idea of how big it truly is, try to imagine an abstract space fifteen football fields long by twenty-five football fields wide.\n",
      "line is: Immediately after graduating from NYU in 1990, I packed a small backpack and set off to discover just how big the world was. Why bother, especially when a good sampling of the world had conveniently deposited itself in my New York City neighborhood? Good question. Perhaps in order to \"expand my horizons,\" or to see if people really are the same wherever you go.1 These sound like good reasons—better than the real one: I simply wasn't ready to start an uncertain career in animation,2 and a big trip around the world seemed like a plausible way to save face.\n",
      "line is: This is not to say that the idea came out of the blue. I was reared in a traveling family. As a young man, my Dutch father had spent several months in Persia, the Middle East, and Africa. When I was growing up in New Orleans, my family returned to Holland whenever my parents' bank account allowed. At fifteen, I walked across France with my father, retracing Napoleon's triumphant escape from Elba as he reestablished his emperorship. The 700-mile trek not only taught me the benefits of a steely resolve and light backpack, but upon my return my parents deemed me ready for the Holy Grail of teenage-dom: a driver's license. Maybe a trip around the world at twenty-two would qualify me for some sort of \"adulthood license\"? Regardless, I'd already told everyone I was going to circumnavigate the globe from west to east like a baseball thrown by Bugs Bunny, so I kinda had to.\n",
      "line is: With minimal preparation,3 I booked a one-way ticket to London and eased into the journey, starting off on the well-worn \"Summer in Europe\" path with a college buddy, visiting England (where I had spent a summer a few years earlier as an aspiring stand-up comic), Holland (a nation littered with my relatives), and France (where an ex-girlfriend was living for the summer) before tackling more challenging regions. By the end of the summer, I'd spent almost a month in Turkey and had fallen in love with deserts and the odd quietude of touring solo.\n",
      "line is: Come fall, my pace slowed as the locales became more alien and interesting. My sideburns began their precipitous drop toward my shoulders; my pants became patched with bits of local cloth; and I had jettisoned the majority of my belongings. In short, I was becoming a Traveler.4\n",

But for someone who's on the road for six, nine, twelve months, or longer,5 time warps as the days blend in and out of each other. You may be constantly on the move,6 but your social life becomes oddly static as you bump into the same people over distances of thousands of miles. You're one of a motley collection of eccentrics, misfits, and cute Nordic girls7 attended to by wacky locals whose boardinghouses serve as flop pads, living rooms, and a source of banana pancakes8 to the backpacking hordes.\n",
      "line is: Cast about in this sea of characters, I spent twelve months aimless and free to spend my days visiting the planet's great natural and architectural wonders, with only my sketch diary to ground me. Doodling every day was the ritual that held the trip together, gave it purpose, made it real. Fifteen years later, I'm grateful to have these sketches; they're my gateway to understanding the weird guy who occupied my skinny body back then.\n",
      "line is: It's not only I who was different fifteen years ago; the world was. 1990–91 corresponded with the end of the Cold War. Germany was on the cusp of reunification, while Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia were on the verge of breaking up. I entered Turkey just as Iraq invaded Kuwait,9 which altered the Turks' attitude toward my American self.10\n",
      "line is: The list goes on: Egypt's Fundamentalists condemning Western tourists, Pakistan's preelection strikes and disturbances,11 India awash in strikes and riots,12 Kathmandu filled with large democracy protests and a Marxist insurgency. I arrived in Bangladesh the day of a big revolt, and the Chinese were more wary of me than they had been in my previous visit a year earlier.13\n",
      "line is: Still, political upheaval had its advantages. One night, I arrived at the posh apartment of some family friends in Singapore to discover two things: I was crashing a large, fancy dinner party, and I smelled terrible. The guests tried to be polite as they surveyed the skinny, stinky, disheveled mess before them, but it's hard to be polite while you're holding your nose and hacking. Just then, CNN began broadcasting live war footage from Kuwait, and everyone ran to the television, allowing me to slink off to the bathroom for a long-overdue shower.\n",
      "line is: Much like my ambling trip, there was no grand scheme to the cartoons I drew as I traveled. The daily sketch might not have been the most relevant or even funny event of the day. It was simply the one that stood out the most when I sat down in the evening and pulled out my paper, ink, and pens.14 Each drawing was made on or very near to the day it depicts, without the benefit of preliminary sketches, art-supply stores, or a spell-checker. If the contemporary annotations don't always give context to the drawings, hopefully they'll include a few cool stories.\n",

He'd wanted to convey all the most important attributes—money, power, influence—and the brushed technosilk Paoletti suit he wore expressed all of that and more—as well it should for the fifty-five hundred credits it had cost him. In that respect, Keene's strategy had proved disappointingly ineffective; while the room he stepped into was completely without light, there was a feeling of expansiveness to it that Keene had never encountered in an apartment or condominium before, especially in the small and hard to find buildings in overcrowded Manhattan. He felt immediately and utterly dwarfed.\n",
      "line is: Illuminated only by the smoggy night sky shining through the penthouse's floor-to-ceiling windows, the lightlessness of the interior made no difference; there was an undercurrent of opulence in the place, of _decadence_ , that  could not be disguised. Keene was drenched in it with every sense but sight: the carpet beneath his fine Italian pseudoleather loafers was thick and springy, the air laden with expensive perfume. He wished he didn't have to grope his way across the room—it made him feel awkward and put him at a distinct bargaining disadvantage—but when he did, his fingertips sped across genuine silk and leather upholstery on the plush furniture. His desire to see made him check all the switches and lamps, but none of them worked. The frantic, faraway city lights did little to illuminate the condominium, but they would have to do. Obviously, the woman had the switches wired to some master control to which only she had access. It seemed he would have no choice but to conduct his business in the shadows.\n",
      "line is: Her voice was soft and absolutely feminine, a whisper in the dark as delicate as a filmy scarf falling through the air. Keene caught himself before he whirled, turned instead with as much dignity as he could muster given the fact that he was standing in the dark and talking to a woman who seemed no more than a specter from across the room. He cleared his throat. \"Yes, Miss—uh...\"\n",
      "line is: \"Mina, then. Thank you for agreeing to see me.\" Something about that sensuous voice made the perfectly tailored suit seem suddenly too small, too hot, despite the meticulously filtered and cooled air in the penthouse. \"I know it was short notice—\"\n",

      "line is: My then-boyfriend-now-husband scared the hell out of me that day in 1991, both because he wasn't the type to wail and because he was suggesting that I do something pretty Kevorkianesque. In the eight months since he'd moved into my Connecticut house, I had never heard him raise his voice, much less beg for assisted suicide. Besides, I didn't own a firearm, not even one of those benign-looking mini-revolvers you can carry around in your handbag like a BlackBerry. The one and only time I fired a gun was during a college fraternity party at a \"gentleman's farm\" in Virginia. Everyone was taking part in something called skeet shooting, which, as a Jewess from Scarsdale, was as foreign to me as doing my own nails. My date showed me how to hold the rifle, I pulled the trigger, and I was blasted backward with such force that the hole in the ground is probably still there.\n",

Since he had exhibited virtually none of the above atrocities and assured me that he'd been in remission for years, I paid little attention back then. We were in love, wildly attracted to each other, eager to be married and begin our sure-to-be-blissful future together.\n",
      "line is: He continued to thrash around on our living room sofa and I continued to circle him as if he were an explosive about to go off, and our housekeeper, an extremely focused Peruvian woman named Maria, continued to vacuum the carpet under our feet since it was her day to clean and I hadn't canceled, due to the sudden onset of Michael's condition.\n",

A sign partially obscured by tall, slim palms loomed, and I realized this was not a motel after all. The sign said _Dream Inn,_ punctuated by a starburst reminiscent of the _Sputnik_ era.

Cats foraging for food in garbage cans, two friends striding to the sea on the tree-lined boulevard, carefree laughter, surfboards under their arm. I live on the third floor, she said on the phone. The mailboxes were covered with layers of stickers, young tenants who came and went and names in Latin letters of people who were no longer alive. The building was rundown and the plaster was peeling. The high narrow windows in the staircase, as in an abandoned monastery, were opaque with dirt. Daphna opened the door barefoot, her hair in a bun, her eyes sharp. That's what I picked up at first glance.\n",

      "line is: THE TIRED, SODDEN TRAVELERS RODE INTO THE OLD INDIAN town of Venango at the mouth of Rivière Le Boeuf. Twenty-one-year-old George Washington had never traveled this deep into the wilds. He had now ridden nearly five hundred miles from the elegant plantations of coastal Virginia, over the crest of the Appalachians, far into the Ohio Valley wilderness, a great forest in America's interior approximately the size of Spain. Smoke plumed from bark-covered longhouses and hung low in the damp, rainy air. It was early December 1753. A deep chill wrapped the forest clearing. Children and scrawny dogs ran on muddy paths. The arrival of the little caravan—the tall young stranger who carried himself with a proud bearing, the shaggy frontiersman guide, the French-speaking interpreter, the hired men handling the packhorses, the three Indian chiefs—brought out onlookers as word spread among the longhouses. The youthful white planter from the distant Atlantic coast of British America self-consciously rode through the native village, anxious to carry out this crucial step in his first mission for Virginia's Governor Dinwiddie—to deliver a message to the French commandant somewhere in the Ohio wilderness.\n",
      "line is: A stouter log cabin squatted amid the bark longhouses, a geometric cube intruding on an organic world. The French flag draped limply from a pole. The cabin had served as the trading post of British subject John Fraser until the French had recently evicted him. This, too, informed Washington's mission—to learn why the French had so boldly removed British colonist and trader Fraser from the Indian village of Venango and occupied his post.\n",
      "line is: Washington headed directly for the former trading post, now under the French flag, accompanied by his frontiersman guide, Christopher Gist, and his interpreter for French, Jacob van Braam. Three French military officers received him with formal introductions and polite respect. Captain Phillipe Thomas Joncaire stepped forward as the ranking officer. Son of a French trader and Seneca mother, forty-six-year-old Captain Joncaire had lived in the interior wilds since the age of eleven. Known to the Indians as Nitachinon, he had great influence among the tribes of the region, moving easily between the two worlds and working diplomatically to ally them to the French. Amid the fluid French graciousness, Washington abruptly asked who was the commander of French forces in the Ohio Valley.\n",
      "line is: Captain Joncaire politely replied that while he had command of the Ohio, another officer, Saint-Pierre, ranked higher. Washington should deliver to Saint-Pierre the letter from the governor of Virginia that he carried in his satchel. He could be found at the headwaters of Rivière Le Boeuf—River of the Buffalo—where the French had recently erected a fortification.\n",
      "line is: The veteran Captain Joncaire had more or less brushed Washington off. Anticipating a formal encounter after his long journey into the Ohio wilderness, Washington may have felt belittled by Joncaire's dismissal. He surely felt intimidated by the wilderness veteran and military officer twenty-five years his senior, and perhaps angered that he wasn't being taken seriously enough. George Washington at twenty-one was a very different Washington from the one we know and hold sacred, different from the stately commander of the Continental Army, the selfless first president, the unblemished father of our country gazing off into posterity. This is not the Washington possessed of nearly superhuman virtue, who, given the chance to consolidate power and rule indefinitely over the just-born nation, willingly stepped down and returned to a quiet life on his Virginia plantation. Rather, this is the young Washington. But not the Washington of the cherry-tree bedtime story. This young Washington is ambitious, temperamental, vain, thin-skinned, petulant, awkward, demanding, stubborn, annoying, hasty, passionate. This Washington has not yet learned to cultivate his image or contain his emotions. Here, instead, is a raw young man struggling toward maturity and in love with a close friend's wife. This is the Washington of emotional neediness, personal ambition, and mistakes—many mistakes.\n",
      "line is: Everything about Washington's life played out on a grander scale than most people's, including his maturing during his younger years. Most young people make mistakes. Many learn from them. The difference with Washington is that the mistakes he made occurred in an arena that quickly expanded from local, to regional, and finally to global, with far-reaching historical consequences. While the older, mature Washington would lead the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, this young, raw Washington personally bears responsibility for inadvertently striking the spark that lit the tinder that exploded into the French and Indian War. This young Washington was accused of being a war criminal, an assassin, a murderer, an incompetent leader, negligent, and an international embarrassment. The war that he touched off would last seven years and spread around the world—the first truly global war. Unfamiliar to many Americans, this war in the late 1750s and early 1760s won much of the North American continent for the British. At the same time, it unleashed the forces that twenty years later would mushroom into the American Revolution against those same British. These pivotal early years of Washington's life give us a picture much at odds with his popular image. This war and his personal passage through the wilderness laid the groundwork for the great leader that Washington would one day become.\n",
      "line is: For over two centuries, adventurous young men had struck out for the wilderness of the New World. They sought their fortunes, they tested themselves. The passage through the wilderness would become a ritual of life in the New World. Some young men set off and never returned. Others struck on great discoveries—gold, fur, ancient civilizations, vast lands. Still others, taken captive, returned with stories to tell about what lay out there. In five crucial years during his early twenties, George Washington traversed between the \"civilization\" of the Atlantic coast—with its gracious plantations, linen tablecloths, and attentive servants and slaves—and the wilderness of the North American interior that lay over the mountains, a few hundred miles away. These vastly different worlds would mold Washington as he underwent the transition from adolescence to adulthood and moved from self-centered youth to empathetic adult, from ambitious individual to selfless leader.\n",
      "line is: Washington's passage parallels what in mythology Joseph Campbell calls the \"hero's journey.\" As the hero travels from the known to the unknown world, often a wilderness, he encounters supernatural powers and mythical beasts and undergoes a series of trials. He returns, ultimately, the \"master of two worlds.\" Through this five-year journey from the civilized coast through wilderness and war and the long series of struggles and mistakes that accompanied them, Washington eventually became a master of two worlds. As master of two worlds, and finally as master of himself, George Washington would go on to accomplish extraordinary things.\n",
      "line is: ON THIS, his first mission as a part-time junior officer in the Virginia militia, eager to make a name and propel himself into the Virginia aristocracy, young Washington felt a surge of anxiety. How much longer to his destination? Governor Dinwiddie had urged him to go with all possible haste, as every delay could be costly. Now Captain Joncaire was telling him he faced several days' additional ride to reach the French commandant who resided upriver at the fort of the buffalo—French Fort Le Boeuf.\n",
      "line is: Business completed, mission diverted, Captain Joncaire invited Washington, Gist, and van Braam to dine with him and his fellow French officers. The travelers received impeccable hospitality. One can imagine the crude log cabin with a fire blazing in the hearth, candles burning on the table's rough boards. Outside, the light faded quickly in early December and damp twilight dimmed to blackness. But the warmth and guttering light within revealed a table laden with roasted venison, perhaps beaver tail, elk, and other meaty delicacies of the forest, brought in by Indian hunters. The French officers offered the luxury of bread baked with wheat flour, transported by canoe down the Rivière Le Boeuf from French outposts on the Great Lakes, supplied from Montreal. After a four-week journey from the coast, the dinner came as a sumptuous banquet for Washington and his companions.\n",
      "line is: And the wine flowed, abundantly. The French officers drank, copiously. Washington held back, tracked the conversation, perhaps tried to ask some questions.\n",

      "line is: WHEN Phillip reached the Socialist Oak he found the fog thinner on the Hill; it had been thick, almost yellow, down in Pit Vale. He had hurried on his way from school, avoiding even the much-admired Milton after they had passed the Obelisk together, in order to be alone to think. A daring and tremulous idea had obsessed him all day: to send a Valentine to Helena Rolls, in disguised writing, of course, lest her parents find out who had sent it, a thing too awful to be thought about. He had waited in his mind, while hurrying up from Pit Vale, until he reached the Socialist Oak; and then, upon the rustic seat erected around its trunk, he sat down. The tree would do his thinking for him; it would put ideas into his head. For it was very old and wise, Mr. Mundy the Vicar had told him. It was older than the elms on the ridge, though much smaller.\n",
      "line is: During the previous summer Mr. Mundy—a sort of harmless joke in the neighbourhood, a genial ecclesiastical figure who wore, throughout the year, a black straw hat speckled with yellow, and rode a bicycle on the pavements of the suburb, and on the gravel paths of the Hill, despite the law—had explained to Phillip that the oak had probably been dropped as an acorn by either a pigeon or a rook, and there had taken root. There must have been other seedlings, said Mr. Mundy; but sheep, which grazed close, would have cut them off with their teeth. In those days the Hill had been glebe land; and it was possible, said Mr. Mundy, that the oak had started to grow in Queen Elizabeth's reign, more than three hundred years before. It was of starveling growth, as Phillip could observe for himself: and could he explain why?\n",
      "line is: Thereupon Mr. Mundy had launched out, much as Gran'pa did, into his rather funny way of talking about antiquarianism. There was something about smoke drifting from the factories in the old marshland south of the river, and the acid dust in the atmosphere, which hung low with fog from the Thames and slowly poisoned the leaves of the oak. So it was stunted, fighting all the time for pure air, just like a human being. For a tree, Mr. Mundy told Phillip, breathed through its leaves. If the leaves were choked, a tree or plant would surely die—or remain stunted.\n",
      "line is: That fact had moved Phillip; and ever since he had seen the Socialist Oak as more than a tree, a living thing ever trying to escape its fate of having to breathe acid air coming from London.\n",
      "line is: One day a wonderful thing had happened while he was sitting with Mother under the tree. A bird with a red head and green wings had flown to the oak, hung to the bark a few moments, and then with a sort of laugh, had flown away again. It was a woodpecker, said Mother. She had often seen them when she was a girl, at Cross Aulton in Surrey.\n",
      "line is: Mother loved the sunshine, and told him about the herb fields around her old home in Surrey, and the wonderful smell of burning lavender roots in autumn. Mother was always talking about how, when Father retired, she would perhaps realise her dream, and live in a cottage in the country, and have all sorts of herbs in the garden, with a lavender-border to the path, from the gate to the front door.\n",
      "line is: From his earliest years Phillip remembered playing under the Socialist Oak, near which men spoke to the crowds on Sunday afternoons. He remembered when his sister was too young to walk, and he helped to push her up the Hill in the mail-cart. He remembered Mother telling him that the round brown things on the twigs were called oak-apples; and about the torn paper kite on the very top of the tree, which dangled there on its twisted string, grey with soot. Mother had told him a story about that kite. It was always hoping that the wind would set it free, so that it could find the little boy to whom it belonged. Perhaps he was a poor little boy, and the kite was his only toy, said Mother. Had the little boy cried, Phillip asked, tears in his eyes. When Mother said she expected so, Phillip had felt sad for the poor little boy who had cried, and sad for the poor kite, all alone on the top of the tree. But he had hidden his tears from Mavis, who always pointed at them, and laughed.\n",
      "line is: And there the kite had remained, year after year, until only a little bit of twisted black string was left, tied to a piece of wood that had been part of the frame. Since then, Phillip had grown up. He had won a scholarship and gone to a school on the Heath beyond Pit Vale; he had made and lost many newspaper-and-bamboo kites of his own in the eternally long summers in which it seemed that the sun was always shining; but the leaning black oak tree had remained his secret friend. Whenever he wanted to think nowadays—which meant when he was unhappy or worried, which was often—sometimes he sat on the rustic-work around its base, and there, remaining still, waited until something told him what to do.\n",
      "line is: No thoughts came into Phillip's head from the tree, as he sat there in the dripping fog; and gradually his fears and apprehensions began to take shape. Dare he send a Valentine to Helena Rolls? And how could he disguise his handwriting, if he did so? For Helena must never know that he had sent it. She might be offended. He knew himself to be in the Rolls' bad books. One of the reasons why they never asked him and his sisters to their parties was because he was a swearer, and rude. They were much richer than the Maddisons, too, though Mr. Rolls could not be more of a gentleman than Father, for the Maddisons, Phillip knew, had once been high-up people. Although grandfather Maddison had been run over when drunk in London, by a heavy dray, and had been rather a bad lot, yet he had been Captain Maddison, of a crack cavalry regiment. Still, that did not make up for the fact that Father was, as he had often said, a poor man; that he himself was a scholarship boy, and, apart from his swearing, must be looked down upon by the Rollses on that account. Mother said it did not matter what you were, so long as you behaved yourself in every circumstance: but that was the trouble, he knew that he behaved badly in nearly every circumstance. And however hard he tried to be better, he never could be.\n",
      "line is: Milton was a friend of the Rollses. If only he could be like Milton—who sang anthems in St. Simon's choir, who was always one of the top boys in his form at school, and good at all games. Milton had fair curly hair; not almost black, like his own. Milton had good muscles, not skinny ones. He could dive from the high board in the Randiswell Baths; whereas he, Phillip, always went a belly-flopper even from the side of the bath, and water got into his nose and throat, choking him. Milton was easy and smiling; he himself was usually afraid, and unsmiling. Milton had regular, fine teeth; his own were crowded in front, his dog-teeth having grown over the others.\n",
      "line is: In dejection, Phillip sat on the seat under the Socialist Oak, hearing slow drips of fog from the branches above, and trying to think, while all sorts of pictures would come into his mind and spoil his thinking. He thought best in summer, alone in the long grass of the Backfield, lying on his back with his face to the sky, and seeing the red of his blood through his eyelids. That was the best way of all, to lie in the sun and let ideas float into the head, and imagine all sorts of wonderful things, while Helena Rolls' blue eyes were part of the sky, and her hair was gold as the sun.\n",

Above him, seagulls cried like hungry babies. He could taste salt on his lips from the spray that filled the air. He'd lived with that taste for months now. He wondered what life would be like without it, without the constant pitching and tossing of the deck beneath his feet, without the regular _crack_ of the sails suddenly filling with wind, without the constant shouts of the sailors and the orders barked by ship's First Mate, Mr Larchmont.\n",
      "line is: The sky above was grey and heavy with unshed rain. The sea was grey as well. For months he had been used to seeing blue skies above him during the day and black, star-splattered skies at night, of seeing jade waves sparkling like jewels all around the ship. But now everything seemed to have the vibrancy sucked out of it. The sky and the sea were both the colour of the smoke that poured out of factory chimneys in England's industrial areas.\n",
      "line is: Somewhere just over the horizon was the west coast of Ireland – the closest point to England that the ship was going to dock on this trip and the point at which he planned to get off and find his way home. He hadn't planned to leave England on the _Gloria Scott_ , all that time ago. He had been ripped away from his family and friends, kidnapped and sedated and hidden away on the ship by a secretive organization known as the Paradol Chamber. He had crossed the Chamber by accident several times over the past two years, enough to make them want to get rid of him. Or perhaps they had done it because they wanted him to do some work for them in China, where the ship had been heading. Perhaps it was a bit of both. As far as he could tell, the Paradol Chamber never did anything for only one reason. They had plans nestled inside plans nestled inside yet more plans, like intricate clockwork mechanisms.\n",
      "line is: According to Mr Larchmont, the _Gloria Scott_ would dock in Galway at the Spanish Arch and stay for a few days before heading to Antwerp. That was where the cargo that they had loaded in Shanghai would sell for the most money. Sherlock was going to disembark in Galway, take his pay like any regular member of the crew, and head across Ireland to Dublin. From there he could get a ferry to Liverpool, then travel down towards London on the train.\n",
      "line is: To what? That was the question he kept asking himself. Back to Holmes Manor, in Hampshire? Back to his aunt and uncle as if he had never been away? Or maybe back to his close family, if his father had returned from India and his mother had recovered from her lingering illness. And what of his friends – would Matty still be there, or would he have set out along the canals for some other place where he could survive on his wits? Would Rufus Stone still be teaching violin and chasing girls in Farnham, or would Sherlock's brother, Mycroft, have sent him somewhere else to collect information for the British Government?

Inside, in a leather pouch strung around his neck, folded up small, was the letter that Virginia had written to him, and given to brother Mycroft to pass on. He had read it on the quayside in Shanghai, and his world had caved in on him in a way that he wouldn't have believed possible.\n",
      "line is: _This is the hardest letter that I have ever had to write, and probably the hardest letter that I ever will write. I attempted it so many times, and given up each time, but your brother is here visiting my father and he tells me that if I want this letter to get to you then this is my last chance. I owe you some kind of explanation of what has happened, so here it is. I wish it were different._\n",
      "line is: _You have been gone for a long time, and your brother tells me that you are likely not to return for a while – if you ever do return. I know the way your mind works, and I know that you like new and interesting things. I guess that going to China will show you lots of interesting things, and I wouldn't blame you for a moment if you decided to stay out there, in the Orient, and make a new life for yourself._\n",
      "line is: _I may have been fooling myself, but I think that you and I had some kind of special connection, in that year we spent together. We certainly shared a lot of experiences. I felt about you in a way that I hadn't felt about anyone else in my life, and I could see from the way you looked at me that you felt the same way about me. The trouble is that time moves on. In your absence my father started tutoring the son of an American businessman who is living just outside Guildford. I met him one day, when he came to visit my father, and we ended up talking for hours. Since then we have been spending a lot of time together. He can ride as well, almost as well as I can. He's tall and thin, like you, but his hair is fairer and his skin tans easily. He makes me laugh. His name is Travis – Travis Stebbins._\n",
      "line is: _The thing I need to tell you is that he has made it plain that he wants me to be his fiancée one day, and then later on to be his wife. For a while I just laughed it off, thinking he was infatuated with the first American girl he'd met in England and that he would soon find someone else. But that didn't happen, and I've started to realize how much I like him. I wouldn't be unhappy with him, and I know that he would take care of me. If I said no, and waited for you to come back, I might be waiting for a long time._\n",
      "line is: _I've asked my father what to do, but he won't give me any advice. He thinks a lot of you, and I know that he wishes you were here. I think that's one of the main reasons he stays in England – so that one day he can see you again, and take up teaching you where he left off. But he wants me to be happy, and safe, and I think that part of him yearns to be free of any responsibilities and able to ride off wherever he chooses, and camp out under the stars. He's not domesticated._\n",

      "line is: Every morning, my twin sister, Bahia, brought me breakfast in bed. \"Up and at 'em,\" she'd call out as she opened the door to my room. \"You're going to swell up like a wad of dough.\" She'd place the tray on a low table at the foot of the bed, open the window, and come back to pull my toes. Her brusque, authoritative movements contrasted sharply with the sweetness of her voice. Since she was my elder, if only by a few minutes, she treated me like a child and failed to notice that I'd grown up.\n",
      "line is: She was a frail young woman, a bit of a fussbudget, a real stickler for order and hygiene. When I was little, she was the one who dressed me before we went to school. Since we weren't in the same class, I wouldn't see her again until recess. In the schoolyard, she'd observe me from a distance, and woe to me if I did anything that might \"shame the family.\" Later, when I was a sickly teenager and the first few scattered hairs began to appear on my pimply face, she took personal charge of keeping my adolescent crisis in check, scolding me whenever I raised my voice in front of my other sisters or spurned a meal. Although I wasn't a difficult boy, she found my methods of negotiating puberty boorish and unacceptable. On a few occasions, my mother lost patience with her and put her in her place; Bahia would keep quiet for a week or two, and then I'd do something wrong and she'd pounce.\n",
      "line is: I never rebelled against her attempts to control me, however excessive. On the contrary, they amused me—most of the time anyway.\n",
      "line is: \"You'll wear your white pants and your checked shirt,\" she ordered, showing me a pile of folded clothes on the Formica table that served as my desk. \"I washed and ironed them last night. You ought to think about buying yourself a new pair of shoes,\" she added, nudging my musty old pair with the tip of her toe. \"These hardly have any soles left, and they stink.\"\n",
      "line is: She plunged her hand into her blouse and extracted some banknotes. \"There's enough here for you to get something better than vulgar sandals. Buy yourself some cologne, too. Because if you keep on smelling so bad, we won't need any more insecticide for the cockroaches.\"\n",
      "line is: Before I had time to prop myself up on my elbow, she put the money on my pillow and left the room.\n",
      "line is: My sister didn't work. Obliged to quit school at sixteen in order to become betrothed to a cousin who ultimately died of tuberculosis six months before the wedding, she was fading away at home, waiting for another suitor. My other sisters, all of them older than Bahia and I, didn't have a lot of luck, either. The eldest, Aisha, had married a rich chicken farmer and gone to live in a neighboring village, in a big house she shared with her in-laws. This cohabitation deteriorated a little more each season, until finally, refusing to bear any more abuse and humiliation, she gathered up her four children and returned to her parental home. We thought her husband would turn up and take her back, but he never appeared, not even to see his children on holidays. The next sister, Afaf, was thirty-three years old and had not a single hair on her head. A childhood disease had left her bald. Because my father was afraid her classmates would make fun of her, he'd decided it would be wise not to send her to school. Afaf lived like an invalid, shut up inside a single room; at first, she mended old clothes, and later she made dresses my mother sold all over town. When my father lost his job after suffering an accident, Afaf took charge of the family. In those days, there were times when her sewing machine was the only sound for miles around. As for Farah, who was two years younger than Afaf, she was the only one who pursued her studies at the university, despite the disapproval of the tribe, which didn't look kindly on the idea of a young girl living far from her parents and thus in proximity to temptations. Farah held out and received her diploma with flying colors. My great-uncle wanted to marry her to one of his offspring, a pious, considerate farmer; Farah categorically refused his offer and chose to work at a hospital. Her attitude caused the tribe deep consternation, and the humiliated son, followed by his mother and father, cut the lot of us. Today, Farah practices in a private clinic in Baghdad and earns a good living. It was her money that my twin sister put on my pillow from time to time.\n",
      "line is: In Kafr Karam, young men of my age had stopped pretending to be horrified when a sister or mother discreetly slipped them a few dinars. At first, they were a little embarrassed, and to save face they promised to repay the \"loan\" as quickly as possible. They all dreamed of finding a job that would allow them to hold their heads high. But times were hard; wars and the embargo had brought the country to its knees, and the young people of our village were too pious to venture into the big cities, where their ancestral blessing had no jurisdiction, and where the devil was at work, nimbly perverting souls. In Kafr Karam, we had nothing to do with that sort of thing. Our people think it's better to die than to sink into vice or thievery. The call of the Ancients drowns out the sirens' song, no matter how loud. We're honest by vocation.\n",
      "line is: I started attending the university in Baghdad a few months before the American invasion. I was in heaven. My status as a university student gave my father back his pride. He was illiterate, a raggedy old well digger, but he was also the father of a physician and of a future doctor of letters! Wasn't that a fine revenge for all his setbacks? I'd promised myself not to disappoint him. Had I ever disappointed him in my life? I wanted to succeed for his sake; I wanted to read in his dust-ravaged eyes what his face concealed: the happiness of seeing the seed he'd sown flourishing in body and mind. While the other fathers were hastening to yoke their progeny to the same laborious tasks that had made their own lives a torment, like those of their ancestors, my father tightened his belt to the last notch so I could pursue my studies. It wasn't a sure thing that this process would lead to social success for either of us, but he was convinced that a poor educated person was less lamentable than a poor blockhead. If a man could read his own letters and fill out his own forms, he thought, a good part of his dignity was safe and secure.\n",
      "line is: The first time I set foot on the university campus, I chose to wear spectacles, even though I've always had excellent vision. I think they were the reason why Nawal noticed me in the first place; her face turned as red as a beet whenever our paths crossed after classes were over. Even though I had never dared address a word to her, the least of her smiles was enough to make me happy. I was just on the point of declaring myself and unveiling to her the prospect of a bright future, when strange fireworks lit up the sky over Baghdad. The sirens echoed in the silence of the night, buildings started to explode in smoke, and from one day to the next, the most passionate love affairs dissolved in tears and blood. The university was abandoned to vandals, and my dreams were destroyed, too. I went back to Kafr Karam, wild-eyed and distraught, and I didn't return to Baghdad.\n",
      "line is: I had nothing to complain about in my parents' house. I could be satisfied with little. I lived on the roof, in a remodeled laundry room. My furniture consisted of some old crates, and I put my bed together from an assortment of lumber I salvaged here and there. I was content with the little universe I'd constructed around my privacy. I didn't have a television yet, but there was a tinny radio to keep my solitude warm.\n",

      "line is: Time is of no importance. I have returned to Hemmersmoor to live in the same house in which I grew up, the same cramped house in which my father and my sister Ingrid died when I was a schoolboy. I pour water from silver ewers onto their graves and pull weeds and put sweet williams into the soil. From time to time, one of the old villagers asks about them and remembers the incidents from forty years ago. Then their noses start to twitch, as if they smell a fire. Their lips tremble, but the words won't come and they drop the topic immediately. Nobody has ever bothered me about their deaths. I never had anything to hide.\n",
      "line is: Our village has grown—rich people from Bremen have built vacation homes here, and their immaculately polished cars park every morning in front of Meier's bakery. The noise seems foreign, life seems to have quickened. When I was a boy in Hemmersmoor, our village consisted of the main street and a few alleys and dirt roads. The houses were old and stooped—the doors and windows narrow and low, the beams twisted by rheumatism. The cobblestone was full of humps and holes, and nobody drove through our village just for pleasure. Even the sunlight seemed different, darker, never without suspicion.\n",
      "line is: When I learned of my mother's death, I lived in Buffalo, New York. I had retired from my work the year before and hadn't heard from my family in decades, had pushed them to the outer limits of my memory and caged them there like wild animals.\n",
      "line is: The solicitor's letter from Groß Ostensen did not reach me in time to come to the funeral. I've learned that not even my sister Nicole made the trip, and she has not visited the village since. Why I returned, I cannot say or even think. It might have been my wife's death. It was she who gave me a home in the New World. She was my continent, and without her, I was uprooted a second time. Perhaps it was the prospect of stepping into my father's house as its owner. Perhaps I thought the wild animals had died with my mother and I was safe from them now. I had planned to return to the States after two weeks.\n",
      "line is: Alex Frick, a friend of mine from the past, also lives in Hemmersmoor once again. The sins of his early years are forgiven—or perhaps only forgotten. He is running his father's tavern and is an important man. We are now the old people here, nobody but us remembers his years in the correctional facility, or his brother, Olaf, who almost cost him his inheritance and who one day disappeared forever.\n",
      "line is: When we meet in the streets, Alex nods. We don't talk much about the past, there's no reason for it. Our secrets in Hemmersmoor were always open and always kept safe. These days the two of us safeguard the stories of our village; we are their caretakers and can change them at any given time. Alex remembers me, Christian, the pale boy whose eyebrows were so light that his face seemed completely naked. He remembers my father, who drank himself to death and whose daughter gave birth to a bastard child. Alex knows that much remains unsaid, but he has better things to do than to rummage through old stories. He expects me to return his favor.\n",
      "line is: The young people in the village work in factories in Bremen or in stores and factories in Groß Ostensen. The farmers have given up, and the boats that once sailed our canals are now tourist attractions. Hemmersmoor looks colorful and immaculate, as if we were put here for the sake of the hobby photographers. Potters and painters are offering their wares.\n",
      "line is: The pharmacy, which even decades ago was always freshly painted, still overlooks the village square. The old schoolhouse is still standing, but two families are living there these days. The once sandy school lot is now a multipurpose garden, and a young woman grows vegetables there. Her children's voices tear the silence to shreds.\n",
      "line is: Just outside the village, near the Droste River, stood Brümmer's tool factory. It was a low-slung building that had served as an ammunitions factory during the last war. In front of Brümmer's, the only railroad track ever to reach Hemmersmoor ended, and in the afternoons the other boys and I sat by the buffer that prevented the cars from rolling into the river and waited for a train to appear.\n",
      "line is: There was no set timetable, and most days we waited in vain. But still, the mere prospect of catching a glimpse of the small, black steam engine and two or three cars kept us enthralled.\n",
      "line is: The factory now stands empty; the tracks are covered by tall weeds. A few years back, a fire destroyed what was left of Otto Nubis's workshop. What lay beyond the factory, outside our village, we all have dutifully forgotten. The county is trying to open a museum there, but who is going to buy our paintings and clay souvenirs if their plan is successful? The villagers are shaking their heads. Why should we have to suffer again? We had nothing to do with it.\n",

      "line is: Way back—oh, not all that long ago, actually, just a couple of years, but back before I'd gotten a glimpse of the gears and levers and pulleys that dredge the future up from the earth's core to its surface—I was going to a lot of parties.\n",
      "line is: And at one of these parties there was a couple, Ray and Christa, who hung out with various people I sort of knew, or, anyhow, whose names I knew. We'd never had much of a conversation, just hey there, kind of thing, but I'd seen them at parties over the years and at that particular party they seemed to forget that we weren't actually friends ourselves.\n",
      "line is: Ray and Christa had a lot of money, a serious quantity, and they were also both very good-looking, so they could live the way they felt like living. Sometimes they split up, and one of them, usually Ray, was with someone else for a while, always a splashy, public business that made their entourage scatter like flummoxed chickens, but inevitably they got back together, and afterward, you couldn't detect a scar.\n",
      "line is: Ray had a chummy arm around me, and Christa was swaying to the music, which was almost drowned out by the din of voices in the metallic room, and smiling absently in my direction. I was a little taken aback that I was being, I guess, anointed, but it was up to them how well they knew you, and I could only assume that their cordiality meant either that something good had happened to me that was not yet perceptible to me but was already perceptible to them or else that something good was about to happen to me.\n",
      "line is: So, we were talking, shouting, really, over the noise, and after a bit I realized that what they were saying meant that they now owned my painting _Blue Hill_.\n",
      "line is: They owned _Blue Hill_? I had given _Blue Hill_ to Graham once, in a happy moment, and he must have sold it to them when he up and moved to Barcelona. _Blue Hill_ is not a bad painting—in my opinion, it's one of my best—still, the expression that I could feel taking charge of my face came and went without making trouble for anyone, thanks to the fact that, obviously, there were a lot of people in the room for Ray and Christa to be looking at, other than me.\n",
      "line is: How are you these days, they asked, and at this faint suggestion that they'd been monitoring me, a great wave of childish gratitude and relief washed over me, dissolving my dignity and leaving me stranded in self-pity.\n",
      "line is: Why did I keep going to these stupid parties? Night after night, parties, parties—was I hoping to meet someone? No one met people in person any longer—you couldn't hear what they were saying. Except for the younger women, who had piercing, high voices and sounded like Donald Duck, from whom they had evidently learned to talk. When had _that_ happened? An adaptation? You could certainly hear _them_.\n",
      "line is: It was getting on my nerves and making me feel old. I'm exhausted, I told Ray and Christa. I can't sleep. I can't take the winter. I'm sick of my day job at Howard's photo studio, but on the other hand, Howard's having some problems—last week there were three of us, and this week there are two, and I'm scared I'm going to be the next to go. And as I told them that I was frightened, that I was sick of the winter and my job, I understood how deeply, deeply sick of the winter and my job, how frightened, I really was.\n",
      "line is: Yeah, that's terrible, they said. Well, why don't you come stay with us? We're taking off for our beach place on Wednesday. There's plenty of room, and you can paint. We love your work. It's a great place to work, everyone says so, really serene. The light is great, the vistas are great.\n",

      "line is: The plane is an Airbus. You don't know anything about planes but if you were going to draw an \"Airbus\" it would be more like the regular school bus, but with wings jutting out the sides. This is definitely not that. The seats are upholstered in blue-and-black fabric that looks new. There is a tiny screen attached to the back of the chair in front of you that shows where the Airbus is currently flying. It's a movie, starring you! (Or at least, your plane.) A tiny dashed line is superimposed over a map, illustrating where you have been and where you are going. You wish so badly that you could fast-forward along that path until you are home.\n",
      "line is: Your best friend, Kath, is sitting in the seat in front of you. Her hair occasionally pops into your line of vision. Kath never sits still. You can hear the tinny treble of the music she's listening to at full volume, even though the movie she's watching is something unrelated. On her screen, two British people start kissing. One of the people is Benedict Cumberbatch. He's your movie-star crush so you change the channel on your screen so you can watch it, too, with no sound. You don't need the sound. You've watched that movie before (eight times) with Kath, lying on her bed, throwing popcorn into each other's mouths—or more accurately into each other's hair. It feels like forever ago.\n",
      "line is: You wish you could go back to that, to undo Paris, to undo everything, especially the stupid fight you're in with Kath. But you can't.\n",
      "line is: Now you can feel her dancing, her chair back vibrating your table. She occasionally bumps the person next to her, who is named Max, but it's the wrong Max, not the Max she likes. This Max is the one with the ears that stick out, a huge collection of Star Wars stickers on his tuba case, and a nervous stutter: the Other Max. The Other Max would never have the nerve to tell someone as tall and pretty and powerful as Kath to stop dancing. The girl sitting in front of her has no reservations about it, though. She keeps kneeling up on her seat, turning around, and glowering. She is pretty and English with an angular face and a loud voice. \"Stop kicking my seat, for the love of God,\" she says. \"I've asked twenty times. I need to sleep.\"\n",
      "line is: Kath is either ignoring her or rolling her eyes. You can't tell from behind Kath's seat, but you're pretty sure she flips her off.\n",
      "line is: \"Americans have no class,\" the girl says sharply, not winning any friends on a flight filled with Americans.\n",
      "line is: Kath isn't sitting next to you because of the fight. \"I'm not talking to you,\" she'd said. \"It's over between us.\" You couldn't tell from her tone if she was half-joking or all-serious. Then she swapped seats with Josh Harris, which is a pretty huge favor to you, actually. You're really grateful. But you still glare at the place where her head moves to the beat, oblivious to how mad you are. She is in an anger sandwich, effectively, with you and the English girl both furious with her for different reasons.\n",
      "line is: Josh Harris is asleep. He is making a gentle breathing sound that you wish you could record to play back whenever you feel stressed or anxious. He even breathes better than most people.\n",
      "line is: You change your screen back to the map and trace the plane's path with your finger but before you can get to California, the screen interrupts itself with an ad for car rentals. Rude, you think, flipping it back to Benedict Cumberbatch. He's leaning against a wall, laughing. He's putting a toothpick between his teeth. Kath doesn't understand why you find him attractive when he's so ordinary. \"Small eyes,\" she says. \"Pinched mouth.\" But it's his ordinariness that makes him attractive. Anyway, he's number two. Josh Harris is, and always will be, number one. You sneak another glance at him, at his perfectly straight nose, and at his ear, which is sporting a diamond stud. The plane lurches.\n",
      "line is: Flying is a suspension of disbelief, your dad said before you boarded to leave home. Now you know what he means. How does the plane stay up? It's ridiculous. Nothing makes sense.\n",
      "line is: You lean your head back on the headrest and try not to think about lice. The engine noise is louder than you remember from the flight over, but you were too excited and nervous that time to properly pay attention. Or maybe this time, because you are in the very last row with your back pressed up against the end of the plane with no way to tip your chair back, it just sounds different. Anyway, right now, everything is too loud: the roar of the engine and the voices of your classmates and the other passengers and the way Mr. Appleby keeps standing up and saying, \"HEY,\" and then sitting back down again, as though his work is done. No one is quieter after one of his HEYs, which are completely ineffectual, except in getting the passengers who aren't in the band to look at him and then sigh, annoyed.\n",

      "line is: The soldiers came late in the day, grim and unwavering. Everyone had expected them, but their appearance, led by a cold-eyed Revolutionary who had once been a neighbor, was still shocking. The master of the house, the Comte d'Orvelon, went out to meet them while his wife frantically made the final arrangements.\n",
      "line is: \"Quickly,\" the comtesse whispered. Melanie, her trusted maid, was rubbing her hands in the ashes of last night's fire. Soot already smudged her face beneath the turban of the Revolutionists, but now Melanie crouched beside a basket and brushed dirt onto the perfect ivory cheeks of the baby who sat within, trying to pull her tiny foot into her mouth and ignoring Melanie's efforts to dirty her.\n",
      "line is: \"My darling,\" the comtesse said on a choked sob as she watched. \"My baby...\"\n",
      "line is: \"I will guard her with my life,\" Melanie promised, dusting off her hands on the plain linen apron she wore. No longer dressed in the comtesse's cast-off silks, she wore a commoner's dress, with dirt under her nails and the sash of the Revolution knotted across her chest. She looked like a common peasant—as she must, if this was to work. \"No, Madame!\" she cried softly as the comtesse reached for her infant daughter. \"You mustn't!\"\n",
      "line is: But her mistress lifted the child, smearing dirt and ashes on her own face and dress. \"I will not see her again for a long time,\" she murmured, holding the child's cheek to hers and stroking the baby-fine hair. \"Perhaps never. Let me hold her just a moment...\"\n",
      "line is: Melanie glanced at the kitchen door in a panic. Soldiers hadn't made it into the garden yet, but they would. Jacques, the coachman, lurked just outside the door. He caught her eye and made an urgent gesture; they must hurry. She nodded to him and turned back to her mistress, but bit her lip nervously. It wasn't in her to defy her lady, so fair and so generous and now in such danger. The baby giggled and grabbed at her mother's hair, and a tear slid down the comtesse's cheek. Melanie said nothing.\n",
      "line is: \"Marie.\" The comte had come into the deserted kitchen. He had aged ten years in the last two months, since he had been accused as an enemy of the Republic. White streaked his dark hair, and his skin had taken on a gray pallor like that of a shut-in. Once so urbane and handsome, now he was disheveled and worn. The Revolution had not been gentle. \"Marie, they have come. I have told them we will go willingly, to allow more time—\" He caught sight of Melanie and inhaled sharply. With three long steps he crossed the kitchen. \"Why are you still here?\" he hissed. \"You should have been gone by now!\"\n",
      "line is: \"Oui, Monsieur,\" she murmured, barely remembering not to curtsey to her master. \"We are going.\"\n",
      "line is: His eyes darted anxiously around, snagging for a moment on Jacques, who again made a gesture to hurry. \"Marie, they must go,\" he said in despair. \"You must send them now, or the chance will be lost.\"\n",
      "line is: The comtesse sniffled, and dragged her sleeve across her eyes. The part of Melanie that had served her loyally and efficiently cringed at the sight, but she said nothing and put out her arms for the child.\n",
      "line is: The mother bowed her head over the baby's, whispering something into the tiny ear. Melanie looked away, only to catch sight of the anguish that contorted the comte's face for just a moment. Without a word he laid his hand on his daughter's dusky curls. Two fingers bore the pale stripes of rings that had been worn for years, and were now discarded. Confiscated. Stolen, she thought bitterly. For a moment the parents huddled together over their only child, saying good-bye to her even as the Committee's soldiers waited outside to take them to prison. Fierce hatred burned in Melanie's heart, banishing her tears as she took the little girl into her own arms.\n",

      "line is: I'm about to yawn and stretch when I'm struck by the realisation that it's not my ceiling I'm looking up at. Above me is a corrugated steel roof resting on light wooden joists. I blink hard a few times. It's cold here.\n",
      "line is: When I try to remember where I am, or what I was doing just before I fell asleep, or even what day it is, it just won't work. It's all so completely absurd and I really don't understand at all. Not only that, I can't think straight. It's as though my brain has turned to cotton wool. Something, though, is definitely wrong. _Very_ wrong. I tear my eyes away from the strange ceiling and take a deep breath.\n",
      "line is: I'm lying under my own quilt, wearing my jeans and a thin pink top, but in a bed that isn't mine. When I roll over, I can tell straight away that I'm not wearing any knickers underneath my trousers.\n",
      "line is: My heart beats faster. That dress, yes. Images from my memory float to the surface, one by one, bursting like delicate bubbles while I try to take it all in and reconcile it with reality. The blue dress... I was wearing it because I was going out to dinner? It was going to be a nice three-course meal and I was going to... Then it hits me. Not _I, We_. I try to sit myself up but my body doesn't seem to want to oblige. My mouth's dry and my throat feels kind of thick. The smell of masonry dust is overpowering.\n",
      "line is: My seven-month-old toy poodle, who must've been lying curled up next to me, is suddenly very close, whimpering and trying to lick my face. Then she stiffens and stares out across the room. I say her name, to calm her down, and I'm surprised by how hoarse my voice is. Then I lift my head to see what she's looking at and my whole body turns ice-cold.\n",
      "line is: There's a man sitting there, on a stool, next to the bed. Instantly, the adrenaline courses through my veins and I swallow hard. He's just sitting there, staring at me. More bubbles float to the surface and then burst.\n",
      "line is: I remember him from my apartment, was it... yesterday? Or earlier today? I've no idea. The thought that I must've been so drunk that I fell asleep flashes past, but that can't be right either. And where am I? As I haul myself backwards in the bed to sit myself up and ask what the hell is going on, I feel a burning pain in my arm.\n",
      "line is: I manage to haul myself into a half-sitting position, and it feels almost as though I could do with a slap or two to get my head to clear. My eyes feel blurry and that's when I see the cannula sticking out of my forearm.\n",
      "line is: Somehow, though, my consciousness has already clocked enough details for me to know that that isn't the case, and the panic strikes me like a punch in the chest. With tear-filled eyes I do the first thing that occurs to me: I grab hold of the thing stuck in my arm and pull as hard as I can. The pain as the cannula is torn from my vein is instant and intense. I drop what I've pulled out on to the bed and a few drops of blood smear across the sheets.\n",
      "line is: 'That wasn't very well done,' says the man in the chair. The calmness of his voice brings a shiver to my core. 'It would've been better to let me do it. After all, I am a doctor.' His speech is slow, almost a kind of drawl.\n",

      "line is: We were running late to the game, which probably didn't mean as much to my dad as it did to me. He was a workaholic who was chronically behind schedule, so this was nothing out of the ordinary for either one of us. Besides, this wasn't _his_ first live sporting event, only mine. And so it was _my_ heart that sank when we arrived at the parking lot at the high school gym in Hoquiam, Washington, and found nearly every spot taken. From the passenger seat of my dad's Buick Riviera, I looked out the window and imagined every spot inside the gym was taken as well.\n",
      "line is: Of course it was packed. It could be no other way. Within those walls were the great Harlem Globetrotters, the ones I'd seen on _Wide World of Sports_ a couple of months earlier. Who _wouldn't_ want to be there?\n",
      "line is: The Riviera added to our problems. It wouldn't fit into any of the smaller parking spaces, so our late arrival to the lot was merely the beginning. As we wound our way in and out of the parking lanes, unable to find a spot big enough to dock Dad's boat, I could feel the minutes pass. Seconds late became minutes late. As my dad made a sharp turn into an alley behind the gym, the way I viewed sports changed forever.\n",
      "line is: There, right in front of us, was the Globetrotters' bus. We were face to face, squared off like mismatched fighters, the Riviera and the grille of the parked bus. A pair of players leaning on the bus suddenly stood up straight when they saw us.\n",
      "line is: And that was the moment my view of sports changed forever.\n",
      "line is: My eyes went to something shiny in one of their hands. It was a can of beer. As a kid who approached sports with the innocence of a Clair Bee novel, where every athlete was a hero on and off the field, forever capable of hitting a home run for a sick boy in the hospital, I felt like I'd been punched in the gut. They were sharing a cold one right before \"Sweet Georgia Brown.\" How could that be? This wasn't the way it worked. My mind reeled. It was a Miller, although I have no idea why I remember that or why it ever seemed important to the eight-year-old me.\n",
      "line is: Both 'Trotters looked straight through our windshield and directly into my eyes. I had caught them, and they caught me catching them. My innocence was swallowed along with the last swig of the champagne of beers. They weren't smiling like they did on television. There were no friendly laughs or buckets of confetti. They glared at my dad and me with a look that said, \"You shouldn't be here, and if you say anything, you'll regret it.\"\n",
      "line is: My dad quickly slammed the Riviera into reverse, backed out, and eventually found a parking space. We didn't talk about what we saw. He was probably as disgusted as I was mystified.\n",
      "line is: First impressions have a powerful influence over an eight-year-old. Seeds are planted and grow from there, often wildly out of control. Tiny shards of truth come together to create an experience that makes the world look like it's being viewed in a funhouse mirror.\n",
      "line is: That moment in the parking lot lasted only seconds, but the impression it created is still imprinted deep in my emotional archive.\n",
      "line is: I guarantee you one thing: What the rest of the crowd saw that night in the cramped gym in Hoquiam wasn't what I saw. They saw a show. I saw the truth.\n",

      "line is: ATIQ SHAUKAT flails about him with his whip, trying to force a passage through the ragged crowd swirling around the stalls in the market like a swarm of dead leaves. He's late, but he finds it impossible to proceed any faster. It's like being inside a beehive; the vicious blows he deals out are addressed to no one in particular. On souk day, people act as if in a trance. The throng makes Atiq's head spin. In thicker and thicker waves, beggars arrive from the four corners of the city and compete with carters and onlookers for hypothetically free spaces. The porters' effluvia and the emanations of rotting produce fill the air with an appalling stench, and a burden of relentless heat crushes the esplanade. A few spectral women, segregated inside their grimy burqas, extend imploring hands and clutch at passersby; some receive a coin for their trouble, others just a curse. Often, when the women grow too insistent, an infuriated lashing drives them backward. But their retreat is brief, and soon they return to the assault, chanting their intolerable supplications. Others, encumbered by brats whose faces are covered with flies and snot, cluster desperately around the fruit vendors, interrupting their singsong litanies only to lunge for the occasional rotten tomato or onion that an alert customer may discover at the bottom of his basket.\n",
      "line is: \"You can't stay there!\" a vendor shouts at them, furiously brandishing a long stick above their heads. \"You're bringing my stall bad luck, not to mention all kinds of bugs.\"\n",
      "line is: Atiq Shaukat looks at his watch and clenches his teeth in anger. The executioner must have arrived a good ten minutes ago, and he, Atiq, is still dawdling in the streets. Exasperated, he starts hitting out again, wielding his many-thonged whip in an effort to part the flood of humanity, futilely harrying a group of old men as insensible to his blows as they are to the sobs of a little girl lost in the crowd. Then, taking advantage of the opening caused by the passage of a truck, Atiq manages to squeeze into a less turbulent side street and hastens, despite his limp, toward a building that stands oddly upright amid an expanse of rubble. Formerly a clinic, but fallen into disuse and long since ransacked by phantoms of the night, the building is used by the Taliban as a temporary prison on the occasions when a public execution is to take place in the district.\n",
      "line is: \"Where have you been?\" thunders a large-bellied, bearded man stroking a Kalashnikov. \"I sent someone to fetch you an hour ago.\"\n",
      "line is: Without slackening his gait, Atiq says, \"I beg your pardon, Qassim Abdul Jabbar. I wasn't home.\" Then, in a resentful voice, he adds, \"I was at the hospital. I had to take my wife. It was an emergency.\"\n",
      "line is: Qassim Abdul Jabbar grumbles, not at all convinced, and puts a finger on the face of his watch, indicating to Atiq that everyone's growing impatient, and all because of him. Atiq hunches his shoulders and heads toward the building, where armed men waiting for him are squatting on either side of the main door. One of them stands up, dusts off his behind, walks over to a pickup truck parked about sixty feet away, climbs inside, guns the motor, and backs up to the prison entrance.\n",
      "line is: Atiq Shaukat extracts a ring of keys from under his long vest and rushes into the jail, followed by two militiawomen hidden inside their burqas. In a corner of the cell, in a pool of light directly under a small window, a veiled woman has just finished her prayers. The other two women, the ones from the militia, ask the prison guard to withdraw. Once they are alone, they wait for the prisoner to rise to her feet. Then they approach her, unceremoniously command her to keep still, and begin to bind her tightly, pinioning her arms to her sides and trussing her legs together at midthigh. Having verified that the cords are pulled taut and solidly knotted, they envelop the woman in a large sack of heavy cloth and push her ahead of them into the corridor. Atiq, who is waiting at the door, signals to Qassim Abdul Jabbar that the militiawomen are coming. He, in turn, tells the men in front of the jail to move away. Intrigued by the proceedings, a few onlookers form a silent group at some distance from the building. The two militiawomen step out into the street, seize the prisoner by her armpits, push and haul her up into the back of the truck, load her onto the bench, and sit beside her, so close that she's pinned between them.\n",
      "line is: Abdul Jabbar raises the truck's side rails and fastens the latches. He takes one last look at the militiawomen and their prisoner to assure himself that all is as it should be, then climbs into the cab beside the driver and strikes the floor with the butt of his weapon to signal the beginning of the procession. The truck pulls away at once, escorted by an enormous 4 × 4 topped with a rotating light and packed with slovenly militia soldiers.\n",
      "line is: MOHSEN RAMAT hesitates for a long time before he decides to join the crowd gathering in the square. The authorities have announced the public execution of a prostitute: She is to be stoned to death. A few hours earlier, workers came to the execution site to unload wheelbarrows filled with rocks and dig a small hole about two feet deep.\n",
      "line is: Mohsen has been present at many lynchings of this nature. Just yesterday, two young men—one of them barely a teenager—were hanged from a traveling crane mounted on the back of a truck; their bodies were not taken down until nightfall. Mohsen loathes public executions. They make him conscious of his vulnerability, they sharpen his perception of his limits, they fill him with sudden insight into the futility of all things, of all people. At such times, there's no longer anything to reconcile him to his certitudes of days gone by, when he would raise his eyes to the horizon only to lay claim to it. The first time he watched someone put to death—a murderer, whose throat was slit by a member of his victim's family—the sight made him sick. For many nights thereafter, his sleep was dazzled by nightmarish visions. He started awake more than once, shouting like a man possessed. But time has passed, and scaffolds have come to seem more and more a part of ordinary life, so much so that the citizens of Kabul grow anxious at the thought that an execution might be postponed. Now expiatory victims are dispatched in droves, and Mohsen has gradually stopped dreaming. The light of his conscience has gone out. He drops off the moment he closes his eyes, he sleeps soundly until morning, and when he wakes up, his head is as empty as a jug. For him and everyone else, death is only a banality. Moreover, everything is banality. Apart from the executions, which are the mullahs' way of setting their house in order, there's nothing at all. Kabul has become the antechamber to the great beyond: a dark antechamber, where the points of reference are obscure; a puritanical ordeal; something latent and unbearable, observed in the strictest privacy.\n",
      "line is: Mohsen doesn't know where to go or what to do with his idleness. Every day, starting in the morning, he roams through the devastated areas of the city with a vacillating mind and an impassive face. In the old days—that is, several light-years ago—he loved to take an evening stroll along the boulevards of Kabul. Back then, the windows of the bigger stores didn't have very much to offer, but no one came up to you and struck you in the face with a whip. People went about their business with enough motivation to envision, in accesses of enthusiasm, fabulous projects. The smaller shops were filled to bursting; a hubbub of voices poured out from them and spilled onto the sidewalks like a flood of friendliness and goodwill. Settled into wicker chairs, their fans laid carelessly across their bellies, old men smoked their water pipes, occasionally squinting at a sunbeam. And the women, despite wearing long veils and peering through netting, pirouetted in their perfumes like gusts of warm air. The caravan travelers of bygone days used to swear that they had nowhere and never, in all their wanderings, encountered such bewitching beauties. They were inscrutable vestals, their laughter a song, their grace a dream of delight. And this is the reason why the wearing of the burqa has become a necessity, more to preserve women from malicious eyes than to spare men the temptations of infinite allurements. . . . How far off those days seem. Could they be nothing but pure fabrications? These days, the boulevards of Kabul are no longer amusing. The skeletal facades that by some miracle are still standing attest to the fact that the cafés, the eating places, the houses, and the buildings have all gone up in smoke. The formerly black-topped streets are now only beaten tracks scraped by clogs and sandals all day long. The shopkeepers have put their smiles in the storeroom. The _chilam_ smokers have vanished into thin air. The men of Kabul have taken cover behind shadow puppets, and the women, mummified in shrouds the color of fever or fear, are utterly anonymous.\n",

      "line is: It has been another exciting year in the SF field for short fiction. In my survey of the works published, more good original collections cropped up from England and Australia and Canada than in any previous year. And the fiction magazines each had a bunch of good stories. So I must make my usual disclaimer, with perhaps more force than usual: this selection of science fiction stories represents the best that was published during the year 1998. In my opinion I could perhaps have filled two or three more volumes this size and then claimed to have nearly all of the best—though not all the best novellas.\n",
      "line is: Regular readers of this anthology will notice the absence of several familiar names, so let me point out that they have neither stopped writing nor is the quality of their work any less excellent than in other years. I believe that representing the best, while it is not physically possible to encompass it all in one even very large book, also implies presenting some substantial variety of excellences, and I left some writers out in order to include others in this limited space.\n",
      "line is: Next, my general principle for selection: this book is full of science fiction—every story in the book is clearly that and not something else. I have a high regard for horror, fantasy, speculative fiction, and slipstream and postmodern literature. But here, I chose science fiction. It is the intention of this year's best series to focus entirely on science fiction, and to provide readers who are looking especially for science fiction an annual home base.\n",
      "line is: After what I perceived as a mediocre year for novellas in 1997, 1998 was a strong year—there were fifteen or more good novellas—but '98 was at least as satisfying in all the shorter forms. SF Age had another strong year, as did Asimov's; they are unquestionably at the top of the field, and have quite similar tastes in the fiction they publish. There was less SF in F&SF and in Interzone, but some dynamite stuff in each, and some top-notch stories in the newly revived Amazing.

      "line is: Gregory Benford is a plasma physicist and astrophysicist, and one of the leading SF writers of the last twentyfive years. He is a science columnist for F&SF, and in February 1999 published his first popular science book, Deep Time. In the last few years he has formed a group, with Greg Bear and David Brin, Reading for the Future, that advocates science fiction reading in junior and senior high schools. One of the chief spokesmen of hard SF of the last twenty years, Benford is articulate and contentious, and he has produced some of the best fiction of recent decades about scientists working, and about the riveting and astonishing concepts of cosmology and the nature of the universe. His most famous novel is Timescape, his most recent, Cosm (1998). In 1998 he published this story in two versions, in the small press magazine Age of Wonders and in SF Age. This text is the second, and longer, version. \"A Dance to Strange Musics\" is like a compressed Benford novel, with all the ideas, characters, speculations, and imaginative surprises packed into an episodic 8,500 words—much of the pleasure of a whole book in only a half an hour of reading.\n",

Even though it was far from the two bright stars it was the nearest star to Earth: Proxima.\n",

It had a humid, greenhouse smell even in the oddly chilly spring of 1997; the frosted skylights let in a perpetually dim half-light. About half the office space looked empty.\n",

They'd been friends since as long as anyone could remember. Simon I remembered as small and dark-haired, round-faced, with olive skin that never seemed to see the sunlight. He wore checkered shirts and corduroys and never seemed to quite come into an adult body—at fifteen he could have passed for twelve. He was supposed to be smart but for some reason didn't take any advanced classes. Pathetic, but so dorky as to almost round the corner into menacing. People claimed he built pipe bombs and had hacked a kid's grades on the school computer once. They laughed at him, but not to his face.\n",

      "line is: THIS STUDY of Martin Luther as a young man was planned as a chapter in a book on emotional crises in late adolescence and early adulthood. But Luther proved too bulky a man to be merely a chapter. His young manhood is one of the most radical on record: whatever he became part of, whatever became part of him, was eventually destroyed or rejuvenated. The clinical chapter became a historical book. But since clinical work is integral to its orientation, I will, in this preface, enlarge briefly on my colleagues and my patients, and our common foci of preoccupation.\n",
      "line is: During the last five years a grant from the Field Foundation has enabled me to concentrate on the study of emotional disturbances of people in their late teens and early twenties. The clinical work with acutely disturbed young people was done mainly at the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and at intervals at the Western Psychiatric Institute in the School of Medicine of the University of Pittsburgh. Austen Riggs is a small, open ( _i.e_., with no closed facilities), research-minded private hospital in a small residential town in New England. The Western Psychiatric Institute is a skyscraper with closed floors, on one of the fastest-growing medical campuses in the world, in the center of the capital of steel. In Pittsburgh, under the generous direction of Dr. Henry W. Brosin and of Dr. Frederik Weniger, I was able to test my hypotheses on patients who came from backgrounds altogether different from those of the patients at Austen Riggs Center, where, thanks to Dr. Robert P. Knight's vision, selective smallness permits a joint and systematic awareness of the therapeutic factors in all the areas of a patient's life. Within the safe outlines of the diagnostic facilities and the therapeutic practices of both hospitals I could study the afflictions of young patients as variations on one theme, namely, a life crisis, aggravated in patients, yet in some form normal for all youth. I could identify those acute life tasks that would bring young people to a state of tension in which some would become patients; I could study their initial symptoms and the emergence of a psychiatric syndrome. I could explore possible similarities in their childhood experiences and discover what kinds of parents and what kinds of backgrounds would be apt to prejudice development in such a way that the life crisis of adolescence might prove insurmountable without special help or exceeding good fate, in the form of the opportunity to deploy special gifts under favorable conditions. Joan Erikson's work in transforming at Riggs what once was occupational therapy into a meaningful \"activities program\" helped me to understand the curative as well as the creative role of work which, as we shall see, is so prominent in young Luther's life, and in his views about work—and \"works.\"\n",
      "line is: Each new clinical experience supports and is supported by developments in theory. This book will more or less explicitly take account of recent thinking about the ego's adaptive as well as its defensive functions. Sigmund Freud's monumental work is the rock on which such exploration and advancement must be based. Anna Freud, with her book on the ego, opened a whole new theoretical area for study,1and August Aichhorn opened a therapeutic frontier in work with young people.2 What I have learned from them, from the writings of Heinz Hartmann,3 and in recent years from joint work with David Rapaport,4 I have tried to expand in line with new observations, first in a preliminary paper,5 and now in this book; a clinical monograph is to follow. Here I will say only that any comparison made between young man Luther and our patients, is, for their sake as well as his, not restricted to psychiatric diagnosis and the analysis of pathological dynamics, but is oriented toward those moments when young patients, like, young beings anywhere, prove resourceful and insightful beyond all professional and personal expectation. We will concentrate on the powers of recovery inherent in the young ego.\n",
      "line is: I must also acknowledge another kind of professional experience which helped focus my thoughts on a controversial figure in the history of ideas. In 1956, I gave the Yale Centenary address in honor of Sigmund Freud6 and also spoke on the hundredth anniversary of his birthday at the University of Frankfurt.7 I spoke of dimensions of lonely discovery, as exemplified in Freud the beginner, the first, and for a decade the only, psychoanalyst. I compared Freud with Darwin, and noted that neither man had come upon his most decisive contribution as part of an intended professional design; both lived through an extended intellectual \"moratorium\" and, in both, neurotic suffering accompanied the breakthrough of their creativity. The address on Freud, of course, bridged the clinical study of disturbances in youth which I was observing and treating with the method created by him, and conflicts of early adulthood which men like him fight through to the creativity of their manhood. Moreover, it seemed to me that Luther's specific creativity represented a late medieval precursor of some aspects of Freud's determined struggle with the father complex; even as Luther's emancipation from medieval dogma was one of the indispensable precursors both of modern philosophy and of psychology.\n",
      "line is: Whatever references are made in this book to analogies in Luther's and Freud's lives are not derived from any impression of a personal likeness between these two men; far from it. But both men illustrate certain regularities in the growth of a certain kind of genius. They had, at any rate, one characteristic in common: a grim willingness to do the dirty work of their respective ages: for each kept human conscience in focus in an era of material and scientific expansion. Luther referred to his early work as \" _im Schlamm arbeiten_ \" \"to work in the mud,\" and complained that he had worked all alone for ten years; while Freud, also a lone worker for a decade, referred to his work as labor _in der Tiefe_ , calling forth the plight of a miner in deep shafts and wishing the soft-hearted _eine gute Auffahrt_ , \"a good ascent.\"\n",
      "line is: I have attempted in this preface to give a brief rationale for writing this book; I doubt, though, that the impetus for writing anything but a textbook can ever be rationalized. My choice of subject forces me to deal with problems of faith and problems of Germany, two enigmas which I could have avoided by writing about some other young great man. But it seems that I did not wish to avoid them.\n",
      "line is: When speaking about Freud to the students at Frankfurt and at Heidelberg, I remembered an event in my own early years, a memory which had been utterly covered by the rubble of the cities and by the bleached bones of men of my kind in Europe. In my youth, as a wandering artist I stayed one night with a friend in a small village by the Upper Rhine. His father was a Protestant pastor; and in the morning, as the family sat down to breakfast, the old man said the Lord's Prayer in Luther's German. Never having \"knowingly\" heard it, I had the experience, as seldom before or after, of a wholeness captured in a few simple words, of poetry fusing the esthetic and the moral: those who have once suddenly \"heard\" the Gettysburg Address will know what I mean.\n",
      "line is: On occasion we should acknowledge emotional debts other than traumatic ones. Perhaps, then, this study is a tribute to a spring morning in that corner of Europe from which Schweitzer came; and an attempt to grasp something essential in that reformation which stands at the beginning of our era, something which we have neither completely lived down nor successfully outlived. Such is the material of psychoanalysis.\n",

So, every day after school, before my mum got home, I would cycle to the Tate Gallery to visit Millais' muse.\n",
      "line is: I didn't want a Saturday job at a hairdresser's and bike riding was not my forte, but I was conscious that I was a thirteen-year-old and thirteen-year-olds ride bikes for fun and wash hair for tip money. Later I would understand that disconnect: \"This is how and what I am supposed to want, and so I will try.\"\n",
      "line is: Approaching the Tate, I knew what was coming. I could see Ophelia's Titian hair, her white body floating down the river, the flowers around her. Sometimes, when I got there, she was dead. Other times she was still dying and could be saved by someone on the riverbank I'd never seen before. Someone Millais had sketched and then painted over, under the pigment, taking shallow breaths so as not to be seen—a man who'd let her act it out, but who wouldn't let her drown.\n",
      "line is: Though I'd never had sex, there were days when Ophelia seemed to be caught in a sexual act, her arms reached above her, her mouth open, beneath an invisible lover. A long time later—after I'd been in love—I knew that she could not let go of his postcoital scent, stronger than the smell of the flowers on the banks as she drifted by. The flowers beg her to stay in the moment. His scent keeps her locked in the past.\n",
      "line is: Those afternoons, the Tate was populated by a combination of the brightly patterned elderly and young, hip gallery patrons in black (the former keeping out of the rain, the latter longing for rain to get caught in). There was always at least one pickup going on. But mainly, on the leather banquette, in the center of the grand room, I'd sit in front of Millais' painting, eating a secret bag of crisps, and cry. Salt and vinegar was my downfall. Before the year was up I'd be rushed to hospital after eating twenty-three packets in a row. Even today, salty food—salt and vinegar crisps, marmite—tastes of regret.\n",
      "line is: I knew the painting would make me cry and yet I kept going back. I doodled her name on my notebook at school: OPHELIA, in bubble print. I wanted to be with her constantly, and when I woke up on Saturdays, I'd go there again and cry some more. I could never gauge whether I was crying for her or crying for me. It is easy to say in hindsight: I believe that she infected me. I was afraid, at thirteen, that I saw in her my own destiny.\n",

And cleaner. Thanks to her labour, of course.\n",

He had got his no-good friends to help out and they had built her a pint-sized palace on a tiny piece of land she had painstakingly acquired for herself through vigorous negotiations with a clerk in the stinky loo at the sub-registrar's office. A few sacks of stolen cement, cheap bricks and leftover paint, and she had a roof over her head.\n",

Besides, what was an egg or two to the likes of those who shat cash and pissed it all away?\n",

The thought made her heart pound, and she steadied it by rehearsing her cover story. She would say that the young mistress had instructed her to add the eggs to the imported dog feed that was specially ordered for her two precious French mastiffs, who weighed more than her and the starved pigs that roamed their slum combined.\n",
      "line is: The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law could not abide each other and kept their conversation to a minimum. She had taken advantage of this dynamic in the past and, if luck permitted, would continue to do so. But then, when was the last time she had been anywhere remotely close to fortunate?\n",
      "line is: Her mother had named her Parameshwari, one of the gazillion names of the Supreme Goddess, and a particularly lofty one for someone of her station. As if that were not bad enough, her mother had died shortly afterwards, and her father, having no wish to be saddled with a mewling infant, had 'dedicated' her to the resident deity at a local shrine, where she had been condemned to a lifetime of servitude to God and his devotees.\n",
      "line is: She had been taught that hers was a noble calling, and she believed it wholeheartedly, even on days like today, when her brain insisted otherwise. It had not been bad initially. She helped out at the small shrine, happy to sweep the grounds, make flower garlands and learn the devotional songs. Devotees would pat her head and give her sweets or coins.\n",
      "line is: When she came of age, she was given more onerous duties and was expected to help fill the coffers of the temple. Even one that was frequented only by an endless stream of ne'er-do-wells who stopped by during rare moments of contrition, looking for forgiveness or hope. Sometimes, they sought both in her arms. It was her duty to help them find it in exchange for the few coins they could ill afford to spare.\n",
      "line is: On important festivals, Parameshwari danced for the masses that thronged to the shrine. Initially, it made her happy to perform as it harked back to the glorious era of the devadasis, but that was before the cruel comments reached her ears—'Her dance is fit to be performed only before corpses being rushed for cremation'; 'Her moves remind me of a monkey, an ugly, drunken one at that!'\n",
      "line is: Parameshwari was deeply hurt. Of course, she could not be compared to the likes of Pandanallur Jayalakshmi, Balasaraswati or Rukmini Devi, especially since she had never had anybody to foot the bill for dance lessons. The critics of her art notwithstanding, she continued to dance. But not before making sure that she was filled to the brim with arrack. Hopefully her preferred poison would take her life before her stupid son did.\n",

Long, low, two-story apartment buildings, built of mud-brown Chicago brick, cover acres of bottomland along the banks of the Calumet River, which defines the city limits. The Gardens looks more like a military camp than a high-rise slum. In fact, it was built in the 1940s, to house blacks with wartime jobs in the nearby steel mills. It was a first home for upwardly mobile laborers, many just arrived in Chicago from Arkansas or Mississippi who would move on to bungalows and two-flats in the city's Black Belt.\n",

The L had never made it down this far; the nearest station was forty blocks away. Half the residents didn't own cars, which made it nearly impossible to find a job that might allow them to buy a car. Babies were born to public-aid mothers and grew up to raise their own children on public aid. There was a grocery store in a crumbling strip mall, but its aisles were so dirty and disorganized, its meat and vegetables so close to spoiling, that anyone with the means left the Gardens to shop at an A&P in Roseland, the closest real neighborhood.\n",
      "line is: In a way, Altgeld Gardens was the perfect place for Chicago's poorest. It was part of the Calumet region, a crescent of South Chicago and northwest Indiana that collects whatever the rest of Chicagoland doesn't want to look at, touch, or smell. The steel mills were here, broadcasting soot so thick it sifted onto cars and stuck in steelworkers' throats, to be washed away in mill gate taverns. The Gardens lay along a kink in the Calumet River called the Acme Bend, after the tin-roofed factory that lay across the channel and tainted the water with its waste. The dumps were here, too, so when the wind blew in from Lake Michigan, it carried an acrid, mulchy odor that weakened the residents' lungs.\n",
      "line is: Toward the end of South Langley Avenue, near where the street dead-ends into the river, was the poorest church in the Archdiocese of Chicago. Our Lady of the Gardens was nicknamed OLG by its parishioners, but to residents who depended on its food pantry or its clothing exchange, the church was simply \"the Catholic,\" as though it were another of the welfare institutions they dealt with on a weekly basis. OLG's fifty families—all of them either from the Gardens or from Golden Gate, a nearby working-class neighborhood—could rarely muster even $200 for the Sunday collection plate. A grammar school, which charged $300 a year, offered a chance for the brightest students to win a scholarship to a Catholic school in the suburbs, although most ended up at all-black Carver High, a Chicago public school.\n",
      "line is: No diocesan priest would accept a posting at OLG, so throughout the 1970s and the early 1980s, the pastor was a black man from the Carribean island of St. Kitts. Father Stanley Farier belonged to the Society of the Divine Word, whose mission was working with people so poor that only Jesus would acknowledge them.\n",
      "line is: \"It was like a village in itself,\" Farier would remember years later, after he had left the priesthood. \"Self-enclosed, often abandoned in a sense, transportation-wise. When I was there in the seventies, you would tell people where you worked, and they would say, 'Oh, Altgeld Gardens.' It had that kind of a name: drug ridden, crime ridden, and poverty ridden. There was a gang problem, too. There was no job that you could get in Altgeld, except teaching in the school. If you had a job outside, if you didn't have a car, you couldn't hold down a job.\"\n",
      "line is: Because they had no jobs, the people of Altgeld Gardens were scarcely affected by the crisis that struck the Calumet region in the early 1980s: the steel mill closings. The southeast side of Chicago once forged so much steel that it was known as the Ruhr of America, although that was hardly fair, since weapons built of Chicago steel defeated weapons built on the original Ruhr. At its wartime peak, in 1944, the U.S. Steel plant on Lake Michigan employed eighteen thousand men and women—nearly a division of industrial labor. But U.S. Steel had a newer plant in Gary, Indiana, and, slowly, the company allowed its Chicago mill to die of old age. In 1980, it still employed seven thousand steelworkers. Three years later, only a thousand remained. Nearby Wisconsin Steel expired even more abruptly. One afternoon, the workers were simply told to go home, because the mill was bankrupt. The furnaces went cold, the gates were padlocked, the innards sold for scrap.\n",
      "line is: The steelworkers refused to admit the jobs weren't coming back. But Jerry Kellman, a dark-haired, tight-featured, intense community organizer, could see it. Raised in a Jewish family in the New York City suburbs, Kellman had followed a radical's path to the South Side. While attending the University of Wisconsin—where he demonstrated against the school's ROTC program—he road-tripped to the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. After watching Mayor Richard J. Daley's police go wild on his fellow protesters, Kellman decided Chicago was not a place he ever wanted to live. But he returned a few years later, to learn about organizing poor people from one of Daley's nemeses, Saul Alinsky. Alinsky had founded the community organizing movement in the 1930s by working with progressive Catholic churches to organize meat packers in the city's notorious stockyards.\n",
      "line is: Alinsky's model of building political power was based on the local Democratic Machine and was one of the Machine's few rivals in an era when Chicago was becoming a one-party town. The churches were the dominant institutions in most people's lives; if you asked a Chicagoan where he lived, he'd name his parish, not his neighborhood. Liberal priests believed in Pope Leo XIII's encyclical on labor: A worker had a right to organize for a wage that would \"maintain himself, his wife and children in reasonable comfort.\" As a result, Alinsky's Industrial Areas Foundation received large grants from the archdiocese.\n",
      "line is: Kellman stayed on in Chicago and was working for a group that organized Latino churches when he got an idea for his own campaign. Why not work with churches in the Calumet region to find new jobs for steelworkers who'd been thrown out of work by the recession that coined the term \"Rust Belt\"? Kellman, who had converted to Catholicism the year before, set about visiting parishes on the South Side and in the south suburbs. Alinsky's model could still work in the mid-1980s, even though religious and neighborhood ties were weaker by then.\n",
      "line is: \"I need board members,\" he told the priests, \"you, and two parishioners.\"\n",

      "line is: Ricardo Reis was a pseudonym created by Fernando Pessoa, the great Portuguese poet. Six weeks, after Pessoa's death, Ricardo Reis returns to Lisbon to take up residence in a hotel, wander the streets, read the newspapers and muse on love, destiny, politics, life and death with his old friend.\n",
      "line is: José Saramago was born in 1922, in a small farming community north of the Alentejo. When he was still young his family moved to Lisbon, where, after leaving school at the age of 16, he worked as a mechanic, a draughtsman, in the social services and in publishing. He first wrote a novel at the age of 25, but after a long interlude his writing career really began when he was 44, by which time he was working as a translator and a journalist. He wrote three volumes of poetry and several short prose works, before publishing a second novel, _Manual of Painting and Calligraphy_. It was not until _Baltasar and Blimunda_ was published in 1988 that his work was brought to the attention of an English-speaking readership. His next novel, _The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis_ , won him the _Independent_ Foreign Fiction Award. His subsequent works, _The History of the Siege of Lisbon, The Stone Raft, The Gospel according to Jesus Christ, Blindness_ and _The Cave_ have earned him a world-wide following. In 1998 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n",
      "line is: Giovanni Pontiero, formerly Reader in Latin-American Literature in the University of Manchester, was, until his death in 1997, Saramago's regular English translator. His translation of _The Gospel according to Jesus Christ_ was awarded the Teixeira-Gomes Prize for Portuguese translation. He was also the principal translator into English of the works of Clarice Lispector.\n",
      "line is: \" _The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis_ shows Saramago to be a novelist of the grandest sort . . . A dramatic work of great philosophical weight, filtered through a refined contemplative intelligence . . . the novel is always moving between delicacy and indelicacy, between lofty abstractions and knock-about humour . . . Not many novels in recent years have been able to bind spells with anything like this alliance of wit and seriousness. Maybe this is what masterpieces are made of, who knows?\"\n",
      "line is: \"An engaging, impressive and moving literary novel . . . The density and poise of its descriptions of Lisbon in 1936 recall Flaubert's description of Paris in 1848 or Joyce's Dublin in 1904 . . . Full of precisely-observed physical, historical and political details and themes, and rich psychology\"\n",
      "line is: Wise is the man who contents himself with the spectacle of the world.\n",
      "line is: To choose ways of not acting was ever the concern and scruple of my life.\n",
      "line is: If they were to tell me that it is absurd to speak thus of someone who never existed, I should reply that I have no proof that Lisbon ever existed, or I who am writing, or any other thing wherever it might be.\n",
      "line is: JOSÉ SARAMAGO SUGGESTED in a recent interview that his major novel, _The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis_ (1984), might be fully appreciated only by someone who is Portuguese. In effect, the novel demands considerable knowledge of Portugal's history and culture from the stirring times of glory and empire up to the first ominous chapters of dictatorship under Salazar. Like most novels of substance, _The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis_ can be interpreted in various ways.\n",
      "line is: Ricardo Reis was one of the pseudonyms exploited by the Portuguese poet, Fernando Pessoa (1888–1935), and the frequent dialogues between Pessoa and Reis throughout the novel constitute a comprehensive and perceptive account of the life and work of Portugal's most famous poet since Camões. Pessoa argued that his three main pseudonyms (Alvaro de Campos, Alberto Caeiro and Ricardo Reis) were not mere aliases, but evidence of the multiple personalities we all possess, contrasting facets of our innumerable selves. Inspired by what Pessoa defined as 'a constant and organic tendency towards depersonalization and make-believe', Saramago ingeniously exploits the relationship between Pessoa and Reis by allowing the alter ego to outlive his creator by nine months, while summoning Pessoa from his tomb to renew friendship with Reis, who has returned to Portugal after sixteen years of political exile in Brazil.\n",
      "line is: The physical portrait of Pessoa is accurate in every detail: he is a slight, scholarly figure, with gold-rimmed spectacles, a small moustache above a tiny mouth and pointed chin; invariably courteous, somewhat nervous in manner, fastidiously dressed and with a distinctive gait. Pessoa never married, and despite at least one brief love affair with Ophélia Queiroz, there were vague hints of sexual ambivalence. He clearly found companionship preferable to love because it was ultimately less demanding and painful. Saramago captures the complexity and sense of mystery that contributed to Pessoa's obscurity during his lifetime and have attracted so much attention in recent years. Pessoa's interests were encyclopaedic: poetry, crime fiction, politics, astrology, theosophy, occultism, magic and freemasonry; a natural anti-conformist, his political views were controversial, his philosophical ideas eclectic and unsystematic, his literary theories influenced by the European avant-garde, by the experiments of the Neo-Socialists, Cubists and Futurists among others. Pessoa even elaborated his own poetic manifesto which he defined as _Paulismo_. Intent upon greater interaction between things abstract and concrete, between the poet's inner feelings and material reality, Pessoa expounded and practised _Paulismo_ in his contributions to modernist journals published in Lisbon, notably _A Renascença, Centauro_ and _Orpheu_. The lasting image of Pessoa as conveyed by Saramago is that of guarded privacy, unresolved contradictions of mind and spirit, and an unassailable awareness of his inner solitude, a poet who confided to his friends: 'I do not know who I am, nor what soul I possess.'\n",

Shadows flickered eerily across the uneven ground. A chilly wind whipped dry dust into tiny cyclones and sent a shiver down my spine. I was standing in the Dusty Acres trailer park—or what was left of Dusty Acres anyway. A fire blazed in the concrete barbecue, the only thing that remained of the place I'd once called home.\n",
      "line is: A trio of women faced me, each of them wearing a heavy cloak in a different color: red, gold, and blue. A purple cloak lay on the ground at their feet, glittering with rich gold embroidery. The witch in red was Glamora. The witch in blue was Mombi. And the witch in the gold cloak was hooded so that I couldn't see her features.\n",
      "line is: \"Rise, little witch,\" Glamora said, picking up the purple cloak. \"Take your place among us.\" I stepped forward. The witches were right. It was time for me to fulfill my destiny.

What did she mean, I'd been training my whole _life_? I'd spent my whole life in this exact trailer park in Kansas, right up until the moment a tornado airlifted me out of Dusty Acres and into a world I thought only existed in books. Then, I'd trained with the Order, learning to fight in the underground network of caves where they housed new recruits, but I'd hardly spent any time at all with them before I'd jumped right into battling Dorothy. Now I realized—Glamora wasn't looking at me—she was looking past me. At someone else.\n",

I'd followed Dorothy into the maze behind the Emerald Palace, leaving him behind. I'd found Dorothy— _and_ the Wizard. And then the Wizard had opened a portal to Kansas, and Dorothy had killed him and pulled both of us through. _Dorothy_ , I thought with a flash of fear. Where was she? If Nox and I had come through the Wizard's portal, she had to be close by. I closed my eyes, reaching for my magic. And . . . nothing. It was gone, like something had scrubbed it out of me.\n",
      "line is: \"You're ready,\" Mombi said to Nox firmly. She wasn't looking at me either. What was going on?\n",
      "line is: \"I'll never be ready,\" he said in a low voice. Slowly, painfully, he reached forward and took the cape out of Glamora's outstretched arms, wrapping it around his shoulders. He looked at me. \"I'm sorry, Amy,\" he said.\n",
      "line is: I opened my mouth to ask him what he was sorry for, and then I realized. The witches didn't want me to take my place among them. They wanted Nox. After everything I'd been through, all my training, they were pushing me aside. \"Why did—\" I began, but I never got the chance to finish my question.\n",
      "line is: A huge, booming noise sounded across the gray landscape, and a crackling fork of blue lightning split the sky, landing in the earth in front of Nox with a sizzling noise. Another boom of thunder cracked and echoed, and the cloak began to glow as it swirled around Nox's shoulders. His face was lit with eerie blue light, and magic crackled and sparked around his body. I could feel the charge in the air, like an electric haze radiating from his lean, muscular form. His back stiffened and his mouth fell open. His face twisted as if in pain. \"Nox!\" I screamed, but the buzz of the magic swirling around him swallowed up his name. The third witch held out a hand to stop me as I lunged toward him.\n",
      "line is: \"He'll be all right,\" she said. \"Stay back until it's done, Amy.\" Crackling lines of power, like glowing ropes, unfurled from Nox's body, wrapping themselves around each of the other three witches. I jumped back just in time as power slammed into each of the witches. All four of them rose slowly into the air as magic spun a golden net around them, binding them tightly together. I had no idea what was happening, but it was clearly something big. Something I'd never seen before. Something I didn't even come close to understanding. For one single, shimmering second, the four witches' bodies seemed almost to merge into one huge, flowing form. In the vortex of magic, I could somehow see all the way through to gleaming emerald streets and clear blue skies, and I knew I was looking at Oz. And then with a final, terrifying crack of lightning, the witches split apart and tumbled to the ground. The lines of power snapped back into their bodies like tape zipping back into a tape measure. Nox lay stunned at my feet, wrapped in the purple cloak and gasping for breath. And then I saw the crumpled form lying in the dirt on the far side of the witches. I didn't have to guess who it was: the red shoes, pulsing with a dull throbbing light that hurt my eyes, gave her away. It was Dorothy. Her checked dress was torn and dirty, and her arms and legs were covered in dirt and bloody scratches. But her shoes still glowed with a sickly red light.\n",

His eye took in the towering mass of the new hospital at the end of the block, its upper floors set back in terraces, the soaring walls salmon colored in the evening light. This side of the hospital, and directly opposite, was the lower structure of the annex, where the nurses and the waitresses lived. In the rest of the block half a dozen old brick houses, squeezed together in a solid row, leaned wearily against each other and showed their backsides to him.\n",

Suddenly, through the open windows at the front of the house came the raucous splutter of a truck starting up at the loading platform of the warehouse across the street. The heavy motor warmed up with a full-throated roar, then there was a grinding clash of gears, and George felt the old house tremble under him as the truck swung out into the street and thundered off. The noise receded, grew fainter, then faded into the general hum, and all was quiet as before.\n",
      "line is: As George leaned looking out of his back window a nameless happiness welled within him and he shouted over to the waitresses in the hospital annex, who were ironing out as usual their two pairs of drawers and their flimsy little dresses. He heard, as from a great distance, the faint shouts of children playing in the streets, and, near at hand, the low voices of the people in the houses. He watched the cool, steep shadows, and saw how the evening light was moving in the little squares of yards, each of which had in it something intimate, familiar, and revealing—a patch of earth in which a pretty woman had been setting out flowers, working earnestly for hours and wearing a big straw hat and canvas gloves; a little plot of new-sown grass, solemnly watered every evening by a man with a square red face and a bald head; a little shed or playhouse or workshop for some business man's spare-time hobby; or a gay-painted table, some easy lounging chairs, and a huge bright-striped garden parasol to cover it, and a good-looking girl who had been sitting there all afternoon reading, with a coat thrown over her shoulders and a tall drink at her side.\n",
      "line is: Through some enchantment of the quiet and the westering light and the smell of April in the air, it seemed to George that he knew these people all around him. He loved this old house on Twelfth Street, its red brick walls, its rooms of noble height and spaciousness, its old dark woods and floors that creaked; and in the magic of the moment it seemed to be enriched and given a profound and lonely dignity by all the human beings it had sheltered in its ninety years. The house became like a living presence. Every object seemed to have an animate vitality of its own—walls, rooms, chairs, tables, even a half-wet bath towel hanging from the shower ring above the tub, a coat thrown down upon a chair, and his papers, manuscripts, and books scattered about the room in wild confusion.\n",
      "line is: The simple joy he felt at being once more a part of such familiar things also contained an element of strangeness and unreality. With a sharp stab of wonder he reminded himself, as he had done a hundred times in the last few weeks, that he had really come home again—home to America, home to Manhattan's swarming rock, and home again to love; and his happiness was faintly edged with guilt when he remembered that less than a year before he had gone abroad in anger and despair, seeking to escape what now he had returned to.\n",
      "line is: In his bitter resolution of that spring a year ago, he had wanted most of all to get away from the woman he loved. Esther Jack was much older than he, married and living with her husband and grown daughter. But she had given George her love, and given it so deeply, so exclusively, that he had come to feel himself caught as in a trap. It was from that that he had wanted to escape—that and the shameful memory of their savage quarrels, and a growing madness in himself which had increased in violence as she had tried to hold him. So he had finally left her and fled to Europe. He had gone away to forget her, only to find that he could not; he had done nothing but think of her all the time. The memory of her rosy, jolly face, her essential goodness, her sure and certain talent, and all the hours that they had spent together returned to torture him with new desire and longing for her.\n",
      "line is: Thus, fleeing from a love that still pursued him, he had become a wanderer in strange countries. He had traveled through England, France, and Germany, had seen countless new sights and people, and—cursing, whoring, drinking, brawling his way across the continent—had had his head bashed in, some teeth knocked out, and his nose broken in a beer-hall fight. And then, in the solitude of convalescence in a Munich hospital, lying in bed upon his back with his ruined face turned upward toward the ceiling, he had had nothing else to do but think. There, at last, he had learned a little sense. There his madness had gone out of him, and for the first time in many years he had felt at peace within himself.\n",
      "line is: For he had learned some of the things that every man must find out for himself, and he had found out about them as one has to find out—through error and through trial, through fantasy and illusion, through falsehood and his own damn foolishness, through being mistaken and wrong and an idiot and egotistical and aspiring and hopeful and believing and confused. As he lay there in the hospital he had gone back over his life, and, bit by bit, had extracted from it some of the hard lessons of experience. Each thing he learned was so simple and obvious, once he grasped it, that he wondered why he had not always known it. All together, they wove into a kind of leading thread, trailing backward through his past, and out into the future. And he thought that now, perhaps, he could begin to shape his life to mastery, for he felt a sense of new direction deep within him, but whither it would take him he could not say.\n",
      "line is: And what had he learned? A philosopher would not think it much, perhaps, yet in a simple human way it was a good deal. Just by living, by making the thousand little daily choices that his whole complex of heredity, environment, conscious thought, and deep emotion had driven him to make, and by taking the consequences, he had learned that he could not eat his cake and have it, too. He had learned that in spite of his strange body, so much off scale that it had often made him think himself a creature set apart, he was still the son and brother of all men living. He had learned that he could not devour the earth, that he must know and accept his limitations. He realized that much of his torment of the years past had been self-inflicted, and an inevitable part of growing up. And, most important of all for one who had taken so long to grow up, he thought he had learned not to be the slave of his emotions.\n",
      "line is: Most of the trouble he had brought upon himself, he saw, had come from leaping down the throat of things. Very well, he would look before he leaped hereafter. The trick was to get his reason and his emotions pulling together in double harness, instead of letting them fly off in opposite directions, tearing him apart between them. He would try to give his head command and see what happened: then if head said, \"Leap!\"—he'd leap with all his heart.\n",
      "line is: And that was where Esther came in, for he had really not meant to come back to her. His head had told him it was better to let their affair end as it had ended. But no sooner had he arrived in New York than his heart told him to call her up—and he had done it. Then they had met again, and after that things followed their own course.\n",

      "line is: I generally have a soft spot for family occasions and warm weather, which is an obvious reason for my contentment today. Not only is the sun shining down on a brilliant spring morning, it is also Mother's Day, and my wife, April, and her sisters have planned a small gathering at our house to celebrate. At this moment I am off by myself in a corner of the sitting room where the windows meet, contemplating how occasions like this inevitably bring bittersweet memories to the surface, and looking forward to them.\n",
      "line is: Since it is still early, I have settled into a luxurious leather chair that my wife bought for me recently. The new chair is also elaborate with stainless steel rails and machinery that\n",
      "line is: electronically tilts the user back and raises the legs to an optimal therapeutic point. It is equipped with a glass holder and a retractable desk that allows me to write with the least discomfort. The manufacturer calls my catbird seat \"The Perfect Chair,\" and from where I am perched I would not argue. Its price, if you were curious, has been set accordingly and would discourage many people from even considering the option. It certainly would have discouraged me if the decision had been mine. But it was a surprise from April on my release from Los Robles Hospital's acute physical therapy unit, where I was laid up for two weeks for reasons I will divulge shortly. It is one of many gifts that bear the imprint of a wifely concern for my well-being, which is a healing balm in itself.\n",
      "line is: Along with the chair, she has set up a new movable desk by my bed, and these two pieces of furniture are where I spend most of my time now, since I am no longer mobile. A little over a month ago, I went into the hospital for what I thought was a routine hip replacement, but while I was under the anesthetic the surgeon slipped up and damaged my sciatic nerve, leaving me with a paralyzed left foot and a reservoir of neuropathic pain. Until this mishap, like most people I took my limbs for granted and had no idea how a useless foot and damaged nerves could take a person down.\n",
      "line is: My wife is understandably upset about my condition and pressing me to sue. I have contacted an attorney but am skeptical about securing any positive result. In the litigious environment of the medical profession, doctors have availed themselves of elaborate defenses that are difficult to breach. Only time will tell whether I will ever recover the use of my limb or whether the courts will deliver me a modicum of satisfaction.\n",
      "line is: When I signed up for the operation, I had not the slightest inkling that a calamity like this might be awaiting me. I had undergone a similar procedure on my right hip ten years earlier, after which I was out of the hospital in a day, and functioning reasonably well within a few weeks. This encouraged me to follow my normal approach to problems: just get them out of the way and get back to work. But when I awoke from this procedure in my hospital bed, I knew immediately that something was very wrong. My foot was hanging lifeless from the ankle, a syndrome known as \"drop foot,\" and instead of my release papers the hospital had provided me with a morphine pump. I could not move my toes. I could not _feel_ my toes, and barely the foot itself.\n",
      "line is: My doctors have told me that my present condition is not hopeless and some sort of recovery is likely. But they remain evasive as to when this might materialize and what it might be like. Nerves apparently have their own schedule and manner of repair. Whether they will heal enough to restore what I once took for granted remains disconcertingly uncertain. Nonetheless, I have accepted the ambivalent prognoses and canceled engagements for the next several months, at not a little personal cost. Two of the speeches I was scheduled to give would have been before thousands of people and carried with them honorariums I now have plenty of use for. I have accepted this setback with as much philosophical attitude as I can muster, having found in the course of many lost battles that it is better not to fight the inevitable when it is staring you in the face.\n",
      "line is: It is also wise to try to enjoy the life you have before the gates begin to close. In the years before sixty, I led a physically robust existence and never paid much attention to matters of health. But in 2001, as the country reeled under the attacks of 9/11, I was diagnosed with a prostate cancer and underwent a radical prostatectomy to remove it. I seem to have been battling significant ailments ever since. I don't wish to exaggerate these trials, because until my present unfortunate case, I have managed each of the problems without too much disruption of my activities and accepted the new limits my body has laid on me.\n",
      "line is: Entering this new world naturally prompts thoughts about \"last things.\" I have written three philosophical memoirs about the lessons to be drawn from our brief journeys on this earth, and this is undoubtedly the beginning of a fourth. I began them with a book called _The End of Time_ , a title with dual meanings since the \"end of time\" can refer either to the purpose that we give to our lives or the purpose our limited allotment of time imparts to them. In this book, I also included observations on the utopian quest for a perfect world, which is a secular religion for many, and has been the focus of most of my thinking life. This quest is really an attempt to deny the permanence of injustice, of which death is the exemplary case.\n",
      "line is: The second memoir, _A Cracking of the Heart_ , was about the admirable life and untimely demise of my daughter Sarah. You do not really know death until you have lost someone you love, and lost her forever. Writing about my child was a way of salving my grief, and the book has been helpful to others dealing with irreparable loss. The third volume, _A Point in Time_ , while slim like the others, is actually a _summa_ of my life's work. Its focus is again the social redeemers who want to escape the meaninglessness of life by pursuing the fantasy of a heaven on earth, while sewing the seeds of catastrophes along the way.\n",
      "line is: While I am awaiting the family's arrival, I can enjoy an interlude of undisturbed solitude in which to consider these matters. Of course I could fill my head with happier reflections, but I won't. Thinking about our mortal condition, and the way it affects how we live in the here and now, remains as seductive to me as ever. It provides my old age with the _frisson_ of youthful discovery and has been the inspiration for some of my most satisfying work. Others may suppose that so morbid a preoccupation on a bright spring morning could only be inspired by the fact that in a week I have a longstanding appointment to see my oncologist. But I can assure you this is not the case. After all, I have lived with the same cancer for thirteen of the most productive years of my life. And who isn't facing a death sentence?\n",

R's mother stays in bed, yearning for coffee and the bathroom, but fearful of nearing the window. She knows what she'll see below: her son's scrawny face imprinted on cheap poster board, hoisted on stave and dowel by protesters who misspell his name. Sometimes they use him to protest another prisoner trade, sometimes to support it; sometimes to urge settlements, other times to condemn those already built; to push for a two-state solution or to warn against it. Once they were protesting a tax, another time something to do with toilets. R's mother doesn't want to know what they're using her son for today. Reconciliation and revenge. Hostages and prisoners. Murderers and soldiers. It all sounds the same from up here.\n",

Taciturn, shy, reflective, almost resentful of small talk, Rabin possessed few of the attributes commonly associated with diplomacy. Repetitious people bored him and the commonplace offended him; unfortunately for Rabin, both of these qualities are not exactly in short supply in Washington. He hated ambiguity which is the stuff of diplomacy. [But] his integrity and his analytical brilliance in cutting to the core of a problem were awesome.\" This is how Henry Kissinger aptly and subtly portrayed Yitzhak Rabin, who worked with him closely in Washington between 1969 and 1973. The qualities that made him an unlikely yet very effective ambassador made him an even more unlikely politician. But some of these very qualities help explain his transition from an awkward politician to an impressive statesman.\n",
      "line is: Rabin was born in Jerusalem in 1922 to Rosa Cohen and Nehemiah Rubichev (later Rabin). Of his childhood he wrote, \"My path was determined decisively by the inspiration of my parents' personalities, by the inspiration of our home and also by the inspiration of the school I studied in. I practically saw myself throughout my childhood directed toward a life of agriculture, life in a kibbutz, and if I had ever been told I would become a military man, I would have reacted to it almost with ridicule.\" Both of Rabin's parents were born in the Russian Empire, and both were radicalized by its dark autocracy; they arrived in Palestine in the aftermath of World War I. Rosa, nicknamed Red Rosa, was the dominant parent. Her powerful personality is illustrated in a photograph that captured her marching in a May Day parade in Tel Aviv, chin forward, her eyes and face exuding determination. Rosa was born in Gomel in 1890 to the wealthy Orthodox anti-Zionist Yitzhak Cohen, after whom she named her son. From a young age she stood out as a strong-minded individualist with leftist, populist, and anti-Zionist convictions. She was wary of organized, structured groups, so she did not join either the Russian Social Revolutionaries or the left-wing anti-Zionist Jewish Bund. Breaking the mold of a young girl from a traditional Orthodox Jewish family, Rosa put herself through a Russian polytechnic school, refusing to accept financial support from her wealthy father and sneaking away from home to attend school on the Sabbath. Her left-wing radicalism was channeled into a Russian-style populism of helping the poor and needy. She lived among Russian workers and was adored by them, chopping wood in forests belonging to the Russian grand prince that were leased by her family. This was a dangerous way of life, and it put her in the crosshairs of both the Tsarist and, subsequently, the Communist secret police. A genuine radical, she was disappointed with the Communist regime. Rosa ran a factory near St. Petersburg (later Leningrad) that became an ammunition factory. In 1919, when she was fired because of her refusal to join the party, the workers went on strike. She found herself stranded without work and marked as a dangerous person in politically tumultuous times.\n",
      "line is: A non-Zionist, Rosa decided to visit her family in Jerusalem to see whether she might find her place in Palestine. She wrote, in Yiddish, to Berl Katzenelson, a senior leader of the Labor movement whom she knew through family connections, and asked him to advise her as to whether \"the land of Israel will solve my problem.\" Worried at the thought of leaving a life she knew, Rosa asked if he thought she could manage. \"By traveling to the land of Israel I have to sever one way of life in order to start another; there is no way back,\" she wrote. Rosa's uncle, Mordechai Ben Hillel Hacohen, had moved his family to Palestine in 1903 and lived in Jerusalem, and she planned to stay with him for a while. In December 1919 she boarded the _SS Ruslan_ in Odessa, a ship that would become famous in Zionist mythology. On board was a group of pioneers bound for Kinneret, a kibbutz on the shores of Lake Tiberias. The _SS Ruslan_ docked in Jaffa on December 19, 1919.\n",
      "line is: Upon arriving in Jerusalem, Rosa was introduced by her cousin David Hacohen to Moshe Shertok (later Sharett), a future foreign minister and prime minister of Israel. Sharett gave Rosa a letter to take to his sister, a member of Kinneret, in which he asked her to look after the new arrival. In the letter Sharett described Rosa as \"an 'important' young woman, an engineer, socialist but not Bolshevik, but worked for a few years in a Bolshevik factory near Petrograd. . . . She has not seen a Jewish face in years, and she is now anxious about it. She is also worried by collective life, which she is not used to. She is very lonely here. The Cohen home is suffocating to her—you know the type of an intelligent Russian girl of the high bourgeoisie who has severed all her ties with her family and social circle and can no longer tolerate them.\"\n",
      "line is: Although she arrived in Palestine as a non-Zionist, Rosa gradually became an ardent supporter of the movement. After a short stay in Kinneret, she moved to Jerusalem to live with her relatives. The Palestinian Arabs rioted in Jerusalem's Old City in 1920, and Rosa went to help the Jewish residents, both as a nurse and as a fighter, having gained experience in self-defense during the pogroms in Russia. She then moved to Haifa and became active in organizing Jewish labor in Haifa Port, supporting herself by working in a store belonging to her relatives.\n",
      "line is: Little is known about the early life of Rabin's father, Nehemiah Rubichev. Nehemia was born to a poor family in a small village near Kiev and joined revolutionary activity against the tsar's regime. He left for America to avoid being arrested, ending up in St. Louis, where he worked as a tailor and was active in Jewish trade unions. In 1917 Nehemiah tried to enlist in the Jewish Legion, organized by Ze'ev Jabotinsky, in order to fight alongside the British in Palestine, but he was rejected on medical grounds because he had a bad leg. Nehemiah changed his name to Rabin and tried again at another bureau, this time successfully. He arrived in Palestine and stayed. In 1920, as an early member of the first incarnation of the Haganah, the Jewish self-defense organization in Mandatory Palestine, Nehemiah took part in the defense of the Jewish Quarter in Jerusalem's Old City against Arab rioters. In Jerusalem's Old City he met Rosa, who volunteered her assistance in giving medical help. Nehemiah was arrested by the British authorities, who suppressed the riots but jailed the Jewish defenders for carrying weapons. Rosa and Nehemiah married in 1921, settling temporarily in Haifa. Rosa moved to Jerusalem to be near her family in anticipation of Yitzhak's birth, which occurred on March 1, 1922. The young family then moved to Tel Aviv in 1923, where Rosa worked in a bank and Nehemiah at the Palestine Electric Company. In 1924 their daughter, Rachel, was born.\n",
      "line is: The family lived modestly in a succession of two-room apartments, described by some of Rabin's childhood friends as being spartan. His parents were fully engaged in public activities in addition to their work; both were involved in the Haganah, Nehemiah was active in trade union affairs, and Rosa in the Tel Aviv city council and numerous other benevolent organizations. It seems the family placed an accent on values rather than emotions; the children grew up mostly by themselves, Yitzhak often taking care of his sister. Friday night was family night. The small apartment, barely furnished, hosted numerous meetings of trade unionists and Haganah members as well as guests from out of town. Rosa was very active, well known, and well respected, but she refused to join a political party or to assume any public position of authority. She had a heart condition, and the children lived in constant fear of losing her. She would, in fact, die young, in 1937 at the age of forty-seven, when Yitzhak was fifteen. Her funeral was a large public event attended by thousands, including David Ben Gurion, the chair of the Jewish Agency, the principal organization of the Jewish community in prestate Israel. By then Ben Gurion was the Jewish community's unquestioned leader.\n",
      "line is: In many respects Rabin's childhood was typical of that of a boy growing up in the mainstream of the Labor movement in Mandatory Palestine. He went to a primary school affiliated with the Labor movement, joined a youth movement, continued his studies in agricultural school in a kibbutz east of Tel Aviv, and went on to the Kadoorie Agricultural High School, located at the foothills of Mount Tabor in the Galilee, one of the best schools in the country. The Kadoorie school—donated by a wealthy family in Hong Kong that built two schools in Mandatory Palestine, one for Jewish boys and one for Arab—was famous for its high academic standards and for its code of honor. Teachers left the classroom when pupils took a test, trusting them to refrain from copying. At Kadoorie Rabin blossomed. He was a late bloomer, having had difficulties with reading and writing during his first two years in elementary school. The arrival of Eliezer Smoli, a writer and an inspiring teacher, resolved that issue. This late blossoming was typical of Rabin, who would have late starts in other phases of his life as well. With Smoli's help Rabin did well in the difficult admission tests at the Kadoorie school, and he went on to distinguish himself as an exceptional student who received a special prize at graduation from the British high commissioner. Rabin was entitled to a stipend from the government that would enable him to go to the United States and study water engineering in California. But events in Palestine and the outbreak of World War II interfered with this plan. In the Arab Revolt of 1936-39 Rabin was introduced to the security problems confronting the Jewish community and was given his first instruction in the use of weapons. Upon graduating, he could not go to California and went instead with his friends to live and work in a number of kibbutzim, though without actually joining one. In his memoirs and in other accounts of his childhood and early life Rabin mentions this fact but does not explain it. It seems that the individualist streak in his character ultimately prevented him from joining a collective.\n",
      "line is: There was, however, another important dimension to Rabin's life at this time. During the summer, when he was not in school, he would be sent to spend time with his mother's uncle, Mordechai Ben Hillel Hacohen, in Jerusalem. Ben Hillel was an impressive figure, a writer and an intellectual and a wealthy businessman. His immediate and extended family included some of the most prominent figures of the Jewish community in prestate Israel, or Yishuv. Ben Hillel's son, David Hacohen, lived in Haifa and became the liaison with British Intelligence during World War II. One of his daughters married Arthur Rupin, the head of the Economic Department of the Jewish Agency. Ben Hillel and his family were connected to the families of Moshe Shertok, Eliyahu Golomb, and Dov Hoz, some of the most prominent leaders at the time. During his stays with his great uncle, Rabin was exposed to an environment and way of life that were entirely different from what he was used to. The Hacohen house was spacious and elegant. In stark contrast to the small, barely furnished Rabin apartments in Tel Aviv, it included a large library that the young Rabin and his cousin Raphael Rupin were asked to organize as one of their summer chores. Rabin even joined his cousin on the tennis court, a game totally unknown in his proletarian Tel Aviv universe.\n",
      "line is: During his last stay with his relatives in Jerusalem, Rabin sent a revealing letter to his friend Hanna Guri (Rivlin). They belonged to a small group of students they named Telem, all of whose members went to the same schools in Tel Aviv and Givat Hashlosha and were part of the same Labor-affiliated youth movement. It was a close-knit group; the members discussed general and personal issues with the seriousness and openness typical of the youth movements of the time. Rabin's letter to Guri sheds light on how he himself viewed the shyness and reticence that were two of the defining elements of his character. On August 6, 1937, he wrote, \"Am I the only member of Telem who keeps quiet? Never mind. This does not relieve me [of the duty] to articulate, but there are reasons for hindering articulation . . . if those who keep quiet want to be part of society, they have to express their feelings and if they fail to express them, it is because society prevented them from speaking and if there were any attempts on their part they were always met by the society with contempt. . . . I may have a sense of inferiority because I do not have the confidence that the members are interested in me.\"\n",
      "line is: In 1941 Rabin enlisted in the Palmach. The Palmach, an acronym for the Hebrew Strike Units, was formed by the Jewish leadership that year with two ends in mind. One was to create a standing military force. The Haganah had a small apparatus but no full-time military force. In 1941 the prospect of a German invasion loomed large. The German field marshal Erwin Rommel was advancing in North Africa, and before he was defeated by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery at El-Alamein it seemed likely his troops would overrun Egypt and invade Palestine. The Palmach's six companies were intended not to stop Rommel's army but to slow down its progress while the Jewish community would try to defend itself in the Carmel Mountains. At that time the Haganah and the Palmach collaborated closely with the British. In June 1941, as the British prepared to invade Syria and Lebanon, which were held by troops loyal to Vichy France, Haganah teams were allocated to assist them with reconnaissance and sabotage. Rabin, who was in Kibbutz Ramat Yohanan at the time, was asked by the local security chief if he was willing to volunteer for a mission. Rabin said yes and was interviewed by one of the Haganah's young stars, Moshe Dayan. It was the first encounter between two men whose paths would cross often and meaningfully and with more downs than ups. Rabin wrote of the interview in his memoirs: \"He asked about the type of weapon I could use; I told him that I was acquainted with the revolver, rifle and hand grenade but nothing heavier or more sophisticated. Another couple of questions and then he muttered drily, 'You are suitable.' \" Rabin joined Dayan's team when it entered Lebanon on June 7 in support of the Australian unit tasked with the actual invasion. This was the operation during which Dayan lost his eye: while looking through his binoculars he was hit by a French sharpshooter and from then on wore the eye patch that became part of his persona and image. As a junior member of the team, Rabin was given the assignment of climbing telephone poles and cutting the lines, his first combat experience. He subsequently joined the newly established Palmach.\n",

      "line is: On Easter Saturday, 20 April 1889, in the small Upper Austrian town of Braunau am Inn, where they lived in a rented apartment above a tavern, a child whom they named Adolf was born to Alois and Klara Hitler. The couple had already had two children, a boy, Gustav, and a girl, Ida, both of whom had died very young, bringing their parents immeasurable grief. And so, on her surviving son Klara resolved to devote all her love and maternal care.\n",
      "line is: It is impossible to imagine Hitler's rise to power had he retained his father's original surname of Schicklgruber. The image of hundreds of thousands of Germans raising their right arms and shouting 'Heil Schicklgruber!' is not only laughable, it is impossible. Such is the power of a name.\n",
      "line is: Alois was born in Döllersheim, Lower Austria, in 1837 to an un married farmer's daughter called Maria (or Marie) Anna Schicklgruber; the identity of his father remains unknown. Five years after Alois's mysterious birth, Maria Anna married a poor, fifty-year-old miller's assistant called Johann Georg Hiedler. After her untimely death in 1847, the care of Alois was entrusted to Georg's wealthy younger brother, a farmer in the nearby village of Spital called Johann Nepomuk, who spelled his surname Hüttler (it was commonplace at the time to find different spellings of the same family name).\n",
      "line is: In 1876, when Alois was thirty-nine, and with his family's support, he discarded his unfortunate surname and replaced it with a variant of his foster father's. He would henceforth be known as Alois 'Hitler', a name of fourteenth-century Germanic-Czech origins meaning 'small-holder'. Alois's decision had little to do with his career ambitions: to that point, 'Schicklgruber' had not hindered his progress as a respected customs official. More likely, he adopted the surname to secure his legitimacy – and thus his inheritance – and to distance himself and his family from their impoverished past. The Schicklgrubers had been poor farmers and his mother and Georg so short of money that they were forced, at times, to sleep in a cattle trough.\n",
      "line is: In early 1879 Nepomuk and three other witnesses made official the lie that Alois Hitler was the legitimate son of 'Georg Hitler', as inscribed in the entry in the parish registry at Döllersheim. And so the greatest impediment to Adolf's future prospects as a politician was struck from the record and the boy's father pronounced 'legitimate'.\n",
      "line is: The identity of Alois's true father (and Adolf's paternal grandfather) remains a mystery. Some believe Alois was the product of a love affair between Maria Anna and Johann Nepomuk, who, just to complicate matters, happened to be Klara's grandfather. If true, that would have made Hitler's mother a blood relation to Alois, and Hitler the offspring of an incestuous relationship. Another widespread belief is that Alois's father was an itinerant Jew who had slept with Maria Anna on his way through town. Despite there being no evidence, Hitler's 'Jewish grandfather' remains a popular myth, wrongly believed to this day.\n",
      "line is: Alois Hitler, a dutiful government functionary, was among those German-speaking Austrians who tended to feel 'more German than the Germans' in the ethnic chaos of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with its eleven nationalities, nine different languages and several religions. He was respectable, even charming, in public, but in private he turned into a humourless boor, absorbed in ruling his domestic dictatorship when he wasn't visiting the local tavern. He was 'an authoritarian, domineering, overbearing husband,' writes Kershaw, 'and a stern, distant, masterful and often irritable father.' If he seems a domestic tyrant by today's standards, however, back then he was fairly typical of his time. He was also a responsible, status-proud provider, with a passion for beekeeping.\n",
      "line is: Restless and itinerant, Alois was often on the move, changing homes and villages and dragging his family with him. In 1892, when Adolf was three years old, Alois was promoted to Higher Collector of Customs, a position of some prestige, and the family moved to Passau in Bavaria, on the German side of the border, imbuing Adolf's speech with a German accent. In the same year, the family suffered a further tragedy: another son, Otto, was born, and died after only seven days. Klara, a devoted mother, felt the blow especially hard.\n",
      "line is: Klara Hitler (née Pölzl) was twenty-three years younger than Alois and his third wife. He had two children from his second marriage, Alois Jr and Angela, who lived with the family in the 1890s after the death of their mother. While Klara did her best to involve them, they felt excluded and neglected as young Adolf received the lion's share of her affection. In 1943, Alois Jr's son Patrick complained that Adolf had been 'spoiled from early in the morning until late at night, and the stepchildren had to listen to endless stories about how wonderful Adolf was.' Alois Jr left the family home at fourteen, and Angela married when she was twenty.\n",
      "line is: Alois and Klara had met when she worked as his housemaid. A modest village girl, she was a soft, put-upon woman, with neatly plaited brown hair, 'beautifully expressive grey-blue eyes', and a quiet, if ineffectual, persistence. She would try to defend her son from her husband's rages, and took Adolf's side when he disobeyed Alois's edicts, as he would increasingly do as he grew older, provoking occasional beatings and stormy scenes. Much has been made of Hitler's father's violence, but there is no evidence that his beatings were any harsher than most little boys received at the time.\n",
      "line is: In this atmosphere, the mother's protective love offered a warm and smothering refuge for her son. Hitler himself would recall, in Mein Kampf, being his 'mother's darling' and living in a 'soft downy bed'. He more than reciprocated her love, according to the family's Jewish doctor, Eduard Bloch. 'Outwardly his love for his mother was his most striking feature,' Dr Bloch later wrote. 'I have never witnessed a closer attachment.' August Kubizek, the only friend of Hitler's youth, would similarly observe: 'Adolf really loved his mother... I remember many occasions when he showed this love for his mother, most deeply and movingly during her last illness; he never spoke of his mother but with deep affection... When we lived together in Vienna he always carried his mother's portrait with him.'\n",

      "line is: \"I'm not finished foraging,\" Fredle protested. There was something on the floor behind the table leg. It didn't smell like food, but you could never be sure. Besides, if it wasn't food, Fredle wondered, what was it?\n",
      "line is: \"That's metal,\" Axle said, adding, \"Mice don't eat metal, Fredle,\" as if he didn't already know that.\n",
      "line is: \"You're a poet and you don't know it,\" he snapped back, touching the round, thin disk with his nose. In the dim light of the nighttime kitchen, where all colors were dark, this thing gleamed as silver as the pipes in the cupboard under the sink. It smelled of humans. Fredle wondered what they might use it for, and why its edges were ridged. He wondered about the design on its surface. He'd never seen anything like it—was that a nose sticking out? An eye? And where was the body, if this was a head? He wondered, but he wasn't about to ask his cousin. Sometimes he got tired of knowing less and being bossed around. \" _Metal_ rhymes with _Fredle_ ,\" he explained, to irritate her.\n",
      "line is: \"I'm not waiting around any longer,\" Axle announced, and she scurried off. Fredle planned to follow, just not right away. He tried licking the metal thing. Cool, and definitely not food. He raised his head and, ears cocked, peered into the darkness.\n",
      "line is: A mouse could never know what awaited him out in the kitchen. There might be crusts of bread or bits of cookies, chunks of crackers, forgotten carrot ends, or the tasteless thick brown lumps that sometimes rolled up against a wall, behind the stove, or under the humming refrigerator. There were brown things in the cat's bowl, too, if you were hungry enough, if you dared. On the pantry shelf there might be a smear of sweet honey on the side of a glass jar, or a cardboard box of oatmeal or cornflakes to be chewed through, and sometimes it was Cap'n Crunch, which was Fredle's personal favorite, although his mother often warned him that his sweet tooth was going to get him into trouble. In the kitchen there were drops of water clinging to the pipes in the cupboard under the sink, enough to satisfy everybody's thirst. In the kitchen, at night, you never knew what good surprises might be waiting.\n",
      "line is: However, any mouse out foraging in any kitchen knows to be afraid, and Fredle was no exception. He was out on the open floor under the kitchen table, with only one of its thick legs to hide behind, should the need arise. This flat, round metal thing was worthless, so Fredle moved on. He found a pea to nibble on and swallowed quickly, ears alert for any unmouselike sound, and wondered where Axle had gone off to. He knew better than to stop eating before he was entirely full. If you forage only at night, and always in great danger, you don't stop before you are full enough. Otherwise, you might have to wake early and wait a long, hungry time before the kitchen emptied and the mice could go out, foraging. Fredle would finish the pea before he ran off to find his cousin. He nibbled and chewed.\n",
      "line is: The kitchen mice froze, and listened. After a few long seconds, they all dashed back to the small hole in one of the pantry doors, shoving and crowding one another to get to a place where the cat—alerted by the sound they all knew was a trap, closing—could not get at them. Only when he was safe on the pantry floor, behind the closed doors, did Fredle step aside and let the rest of the kitchen mice pass him by. He was waiting for Grandfather, who was old and slow. When Grandfather squeezed through the hole, the two of them climbed up between the walls together.\n",
      "line is: At their nest, the mice counted themselves—\"Mother?\" \"Grandfather?\" \"Kortle?\" \"Kidle?\" and on through all fifteen of them—and were breathing a collective sigh of relief when Uncle Dakle came peeping over the rim. \"Is she here?\" he asked. \"Our Axle, is she with your Fredle?\"\n",
      "line is: _Went_ , they all thought, but nobody said it out loud. Right away they started to forget Axle. Fredle, although he knew it was against the rules, silently recalled everything he could about his cousin, the quick sound of her nails on the floorboards, the gleam of her white teeth when she yawned at one of Grandfather's stories, the proud lift of her tail. \"Why—\" he started to ask, because now he was wondering _why_ they had to forget, as if a went mouse had never lived with them, but he was silenced by an odd sound, and there was something he smelled....\n",
      "line is: Everybody froze, as mice do when they are afraid, waiting motionless and, they hoped, invisible. Everybody listened. Was it a mouse sound they were hearing? It couldn't be a cat, could it? Something was scratching lightly along the floorboards. Was that breathing? What could smell like that? What if the cat had found a way in between the walls?\n",

      "line is: To be honest, the foxes may have started as a joke.\n",
      "line is: A few years back, I started writing a space opera novel called (at the time) _Ninefox and Suicide Hawk_. I later changed the submissions title to _Ninefox Gambit_ —as one of my friends remarked, the original title sounded like it came out of a superhero comic—but the fox remained a central image. One of the characters, a tactician, was called the Immolation Fox and was an all-around devious bastard. This was partly in reaction to the foxwives of Legend of the Five Rings (L5R), a game I played and loved when I was younger, and later had the privilege of writing game fiction for. One thing always bothered me about the setting, however, which was that the foxwives of L5R managed to be _cuddly_. (Also unlucky.) And if there was one thing I remembered from the fox spirit stories of Korea, which have similarities to the Japanese version, it's that fox spirits aren't _cuddly_.\n",
      "line is: Naturally, I hypocritically started writing cuddly foxes myself. Maybe it comes from staring at cute fox photos on Tumblr. Maybe it's the foxaganda.\n",
      "line is: As for the flash fairy tales, they started because I was looking to make quick cash. I wanted to buy a relatively inexpensive font, so I sold flash fiction at $6 a pop. It was a length I hadn't previously experimented much with because it was such a hassle. At the time I started submitting, there didn't seem to be many venues that accepted flash fiction, or paid for it either. I stuck to stories of 2,000 words and up. And even when markets did accept flash, I still had to go to the trouble of sending it in and waiting for a response, which might or might not be an acceptance, and then wait beyond that for the payment. With this setup, selling stories directly to people on reading my blogs on LiveJournal and Dreamwidth, the deal was that I got paid in advance and the buyer got the story they got. I wasn't sure if anyone would go for it—but people did. And furthermore, I discovered that I really enjoyed writing at this length, and that I could usually dash off a draft in a half-hour or less.\n",
      "line is: Flash fiction is interesting in that you can't waste any words. It's well-suited for jeweled imagery, and also well-suited for fairy tales or similar because you can evoke a great deal using archetypes. The fact that these were commissioned stories also meant that I deliberately wrote more upbeat stories than the usual. If you're familiar with my longer work, a lot of which deals with war, you'll know that \"upbeat\" isn't how it's usually described. But people don't like downers, so I default to more cheerful (or at least, not outright sad) stories unless specifically requested. And a few of these I wrote for my own amusement, so there's a little variation in tone.\n",
      "line is: There are four new stories in this collection for your enjoyment: \"The River Soldier,\" \"The Stone-Hearted Soldier,\" \"The Witch and Her Lover,\" and \"The Rose and the Peacock.\" No foxes in those stories, but foxes are tricky enough to maneuver around as it is. I hope there are enough of them in the rest of this collection to satisfy any vulpine-lover's heart.\n",

Even so, the walls were notched with pale crescent marks, crisscrossed into a tapestry of patient waiting. Sometimes dew jeweled the rough-hewn stone floor; sometimes ice obscured the walls' pale marks, and he wondered if the world outside had forgotten his existence.\n",

      "line is: The story was an old one, but the prisoner did not expect a fox to be familiar with it. \"I offended the lady to whom I had sworn fealty,\" he said. \"As a punishment, she set me here, to wait unaging until the forest should be no more.\"\n",

At the present moment in our world this necessity is especially true in regard to China, one of the oldest countries.\n",
      "line is: Chin Shih Huang was China's first emperor, thousands of years ago—to be exact, his dynasty was from 220 B.C. to A.D. 207. At that time China was not one country but six countries, all trying to live together in peace, but more often actually at war. The ambitious young king of the country called Chin decided to make war on all the other countries and establish them under his rule as First Emperor. He attacked country by country, until at last he ruled them all and governed an entire vast nation.\n",
      "line is: Chin Shih Huang established China as we know it today, and the pattern is clear through the centuries. Dynasty followed dynasty in the same imperial fashion, only twice broken by foreign conquerors but always regained by the Chinese. Of course there were periods of chaos as one dynasty merged into another, and it was in such a period of change that I lived most of my long life in China, beginning when I was three months old, when my parents took me to China with them, and where I lived until I was more than forty years old. It is in this period that Elizabeth Lewis has placed her story of Young Fu.\n",
      "line is: What kind of a period was it? It was a period of revolution, struggle, and wars. The old empress, Tzu Hsi, died in 1909. Immediately contenders for the Imperial Throne rose up, each with his private army, to fight all others, one by one. These contenders, bold ambitious men, were called tuchun. Each ruled temporarily in his area until another drove him away. Meanwhile, the people waited until one final conqueror would prove himself victor over all the others and become the first emperor of a new dynasty. Such periods were always dangerous, for robbers roamed and rascals thrived. This book tells of such troubles. People's lives and businesses were always unsafe, and there was often little difference, if any, between a bandit and a soldier. People were killed in their homes and shops, and only the very poor were safe.\n",
      "line is: Young Fu's life, so well portrayed by Elizabeth Lewis, was in the years of turmoil, after the old empress died. In this disorganized period he did his best to live an honest, hardworking life, and it is his story that is here told with faithful attention to the difficult and dangerous times in which he lived. To understand the vast, complex China of today, one must try to learn about its past. The story of Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze is a prologue to modern China.\n",
      "line is: Young Fu stood on the narrow curbing before Dai's two-storied tenement in Chair-Makers' Way, Chungking, and stared about him. In the doorway, Fu Be Be, his mother, directed load-coolies in placing the household goods which she had brought from home, and anxiously examined each article as it passed before her. A day of clattering over country roads, followed by two on the crowded freight boat, had been difficult indeed for her, but the furniture looked no worse for wear than did her son. For him the hours had flowed into the past as swiftly as the current of the river. He had been fascinated by shifting scenes and strange faces; the constant menace of bandits with which all travel was shadowed had added its own flavor to the experience, and when at last Chungking's great walls had loomed above them, it had seemed the fulfillment of all his dreams.\n",
      "line is: He turned in the direction of a yell as one of the load-bearers lowered his burden of a pigskin trunk on the bare foot of a bystander. In a flash the two men, their faces white with anger, were after each other.\n",
      "line is: The carrier, unlike the Chungkingese about him, wore a queue, and the bystander stretched out a hand, grabbed the tail of hair, and pulled viciously. The queue, half of which was false hair plaited in with string, came apart in his hand and the onlookers roared. Furious with chagrin, the victim lifted his carrying pole to strike. As he did so, an unexpected clamor in the street drew everyone's attention, and the bystander seized this opportunity to lose himself in the crowd.\n",
      "line is: A handsome red wedding chair, ornately decorated with gold, rolled past. Hidden completely behind its satin-hung curtains, sat a youthful bride on the way to her new home. A long train of coolies followed the chair, swinging great, painted trays on which rested roast fowls and sweetmeats, silk bed comforts and hard, lacquered pillows, sealed boxes of clothing, and pieces of furniture—all of the contributions essential to any dowry. When the last of these had disappeared from sight, the angry carrier, who had succeeded in plaiting his queue to its original length, stooped, picked up his pole, and resumed work as if nothing had ever disturbed him.\n",
      "line is: Fu Be Be breathed a sigh of relief. After the quiet countryside, this city was providing more excitement than she could well endure, but she would have to be content for her son's sake.\n",
      "line is: Young Fu, unconscious of anything but the fact that he was now in Chungking, drew a long breath of delight. In his village men who counted it a privilege to visit this city once in a lifetime had told of its wonders.\n",

      "line is: A valid semiquestion and certainly better than simply bolting, which, hey, he could have done.\n",
      "line is: \"It's an emergency,\" she said, waving her hand in what she hoped was a can we please move this along gesture.\n",
      "line is: \"Fine.\" She drew in a breath, then began talking. Fast. \"I have a wedding in less than an hour and I'm one Roman soldier short. J.T. ran off to LA because his agent called about an audition. Note to self. Do not hire actors during pilot season. Anyway, I need a Roman soldier. You're about the same height as the other guys and you're here because you need a job, so take your shirt off, please. If you look halfway decent, I'll sponge tan you and you'll carry a very skinny girl in on a palanquin.\"\n",
      "line is: \"One of those sedan chair things. I swear, she probably doesn't even weigh a hundred pounds. I don't think she's eaten in three months. You look strong. You'll do great. Please? There's a check at the end.\"\n",
      "line is: Not a very big one, but money was money. And Nick Mitchell had answered her ad for a part-time carpenter, so he must be at least a little desperate for money. A feeling Pallas could so relate to.\n",
      "line is: Why were the pretty ones always dumb, she wondered with a sigh. Because Nick certainly qualified as pretty. Tall with dark hair and eyes. His shoulders were broad and from what she could see, he looked to be in shape, so what was the big deal?\n",
      "line is: \"The name of my business is Weddings in a Box.\" She gestured to the walls around them. \"This is box-like. People come here to get married. I do theme weddings. The couple today want a Roman wedding. You'd be stunned at how popular they are. The Roman wedding includes the palanquin for the bride. Please, I beg you. Take off your shirt.\"\n",
      "line is: \"You're weird,\" Nick muttered as he unbuttoned his shirt and tossed it onto her desk.\n",
      "line is: Hallelujah, she thought, walking around to view him from the back. As she'd hoped, he looked good—with broad shoulders and plenty of muscle. No massive tattoos, no ugly scars. Not that she objected to tattoos, but so few of them were Roman wedding appropriate and she really didn't have time to do her thing with concealer. As it was, Nick would fit in with the other guys perfectly.\n",

      "line is: Sherlock Holmes leaned forward in his seat, entranced, as the young man on the stage brought his violin up to his shoulder, nestled his chin into the chin-guard and raised his bow until it hovered above the strings. The flickering light from the gas lamps along the edge of the stage illuminated the violinist with dancing shadows, making it seem as if a hundred different  expressions were playing across his face within a few moments.\n",
      "line is: The audience seemed to tense. For a long moment you could have heard a handkerchief flutter to the ground, it was that quiet in the theatre, and then he started playing.\n",
      "line is: The first note swelled up out of nowhere until it filled the auditorium. It was pure and exquisite, and the sort of note that Sherlock would have given a year of his life to be able to play. It seemed to him almost impossible that something made out of wood and catgut, played by someone human and fallible, could be that close to perfection.\n",
      "line is: 'He's playing a Stradivarius,' Rufus Stone whispered from beside Sherlock, but Sherlock's attention was fixed upon the young man onstage, and he barely registered his friend and tutor's words. He concentrated on the music, on the succession of notes and chords that were emanating from the small stage as if they were something absolutely real and it was the theatre and the audience who were insubstantial. Sherlock had never imagined that it was possible to play the violin that beautifully.\n",
      "line is: For the next forty-five minutes Sherlock listened, oblivious to anything around him, barely even breathing, as the violinist played a succession of pieces. One or two Sherlock recognized from his own exercises – some Spanish dances, and a few well-known tunes from operas – but many were new to him. He suspected that the man had written them himself, he appeared to be that comfortable playing them. Some of them were fiendishly complicated as well as beautiful, requiring the violinist's left hand to move along the fingerboard so fast that it was a blur.\n",
      "line is: After a while he became aware that his brother, Mycroft, seated on the other side of him to Rufus Stone, was shifting in his plushly upholstered seat. It was too small for him in the first place, and his elbows were pushing against Sherlock's arm and the arm of the man on the other side of him. Sherlock could hear him huff every now and then, as if he was unconsciously trying to send a signal out to everyone around him that he was unhappy and wanted to be somewhere else. Or perhaps it wasn't unconscious. Perhaps Mycroft knew exactly what signal he was sending to the increasingly irritated people around him, and just didn't care.\n",
      "line is: After a particularly difficult volley of notes which the violinist threw away as if they were nothing, the first half of the concert ended. The musician bowed to enthusiastic applause, and the curtain came down.\n",
      "line is: 'Thank the Lord,' Mycroft muttered. 'I was beginning to think that I had died and gone to hell. Who did you say this young fiddler was?'\n",
      "line is: Sherlock glanced sideways at Rufus Stone. The expression on Stone's face was somewhere in the ambiguous territory between amusement and outrage. 'His name is Pablo Sarasate,' Stone said in a carefully controlled voice. 'He is Spanish, he is twenty-six years old, and he is probably the most accomplished violinist since Niccolò Paganini.'\n",
      "line is: 'Humph!' Mycroft said. 'I would have preferred a brass band in the park. The music would be more tuneful to my ears.'\n",
      "line is: 'And the deckchairs would be more accommodating to your . . .' Stone hesitated. Sherlock sympathized – Mycroft was technically Stone's employer. '. . . To your natural sitting position,' Stone finished smoothly.\n",

Sure enough, a few minutes later, her e-mail program dinged announcing that she had new mail. As anticipated, the sender was Coach1012. She opened the e-mail and began to read.\n",

The kids don't care as much as the parents do, though. You should have heard 'em second-guessing me afterward. But criticism goes with the territory. You just gotta ignore it and remember it's not world peace or anything even close.\n",

      "line is: She and Coach had become friends about six months earlier through the online game, and she enjoyed the friendship and competition between them. But the bottom line was, although they had discussed all kinds of personal likes and dislikes and had talked about their families and Lorna's divorce and Coach's dating life—even having discussions about religion and politics and the state of the world—they had never revealed identifying information about themselves.\n",
      "line is: The thing was, it was too easy to misrepresent yourself when your only contact was via the Internet, and as a single woman—not to mention, a wealthy single woman—Lorna knew she couldn't be too careful. She'd had enough bad experiences with men being more attracted to her money and position than they were to her—including her ex-husband—and she didn't intend to get burned again.\n",
      "line is: So up front, she'd told Coach she preferred remaining anonymous, and he'd agreed readily, which then made her wonder if he had something to hide. She'd laughed at herself, because he was probably wondering the same thing about her. She finally decided he'd also recognized the need for caution, and she respected that. It showed her he was a sensible man with a good head on his shoulders.\n",

      "line is: The year 2001 was an excellent one for the science fiction short story. The stories were often challenging, thought-provoking, and entertaining in the ways that make SF a unique genre. It was a year of great excitement, great tragedy in the real world, and great change. There is a war going on.\n",
      "line is: In 2001, books by the big names were selling better than ever, sliding through the publishing and distribution process perhaps even easier than before. Hardcover editions contributed substantially to the support of every SF publishing line. The trade paperback was well-established as the safety net of a number of publishers and writers. The small presses were again a vigorous presence. We have a strong short fiction field today because the small presses, semi-professional magazines, and anthologies are printing and circulating a majority of the high-quality fiction published in sf and fantasy and horror. The U.S. is the only English language country that still has any professional, large-circulation magazines, though Canada, Australia, and the UK have several excellent magazines. The semi-prozines of our field mirror the \"little magazines\" of the mainstream in function, holding to professional editorial standards and publishing the next generation of writers, along with some of the present masters. What a change that is in the U.S.—though this trend has been emerging for more than a decade.\n",
      "line is: We must not forget the SF Book Club, so much a part of the SF field that it is often as invisible, unless we look up, as the skyscrapers we pass on our way to work in the city. Good anthologies and collections are harder than ever to select on the bookstore shelves from among the mediocre ones, but you will find some of the best books each year selected for SFBC editions, often the only hardcover edition of those anthologies.\n",
      "line is: The best original anthologies of the year in our opinion were Starlight 3, edited by Patrick Nielsen Hayden (Tor) and Red Shift, edited by Al Sarrantonio (Roc). Of those, the particular excellences of Starlight were mostly in the realm of fantasy, and the especial pleasures of Red Shift were in SF. So you will find some stories here from Red Shift, but should look to our companion, Year's Best Fantasy 2, for some stories from the Nielsen Hayden book.\n",
      "line is: I write in December 2001, but the anxious outlines of the publishing future are becoming clear for the SF field in 2002. SF publishing as we have known it is nine mass market publishing lines (Ace, Bantam, Baen, DAW, Del Rey, Eos, Roc, Tor, Warner), ten if you count Pocket Book's Star Trek line, and those lines are hard-pressed to continue distributing the number of new titles they have been able to in the past. Mass market distributors are pressing all publishers to reduce the number of titles and just publish \"big books.\" The last SF and Fantasy magazines that are widely distributed (Analog, Asimov's, F&SF, Realms of Fantasy) are being charged more by the same distributors for distribution because they are not as high-circulation as The New Yorker or Playboy (which are also under pressure). So the in-field magazines are hard-pressed but are only a special case of the widespread difficulties facing all magazines.\n",
      "line is: In 2001, the air went out of electronic bookselling. Amazon.com fired a lot of people and closed warehouses, intending to claim a profit in early 2002. Barnes & Noble folded its dotcom division back into the bookstore chain, with attendant layoffs. And electronic text failed to live up to the advance publicity (both Random House and Warner closed their etext operations by the end of 2001). Print-on-demand became a very small success. The Wall Street Journal, in a late-year article surveying 2500 titles, quoted the figure of 88 copies as the average sale of a print-on-demand title.\n",
      "line is: Of the several high-paying online short fiction markets announced last year that helped to cushion the loss of print media markets for short fiction, one survives. We found some excellent science fiction from editor Ellen Datlow's Scifiction site, now the highest-paying market in the genre for short fiction. We offer three stories from it, for perhaps the first time in print, in this book.\n",
      "line is: It was another good year to be reading the magazines, both pro and semi-professional. It was a strong year for novellas, and there were more than a hundred shorter stories in consideration, from which we made our final selection. So we repeat, for readers new to this series, the usual disclaimer: This selection of science fiction stories represents the best that was published during the year 2001. It would take two or three more volumes this size to have nearly all of the best—though even then, not all the best novellas. We believe that representing the best from year to year, while it is not physically possible to encompass it all in one even very large book, also implies presenting some substantial variety of excellences, and we left some worthy stories out in order to include others in this limited space.\n",
      "line is: Our general principle for selection: This book is full of science fiction—every story in the book is clearly that and not something else. We have a high regard for horror, fantasy, speculative fiction, and slipstream, and postmodern literature. We (Kathryn Cramer and David G. Hartwell) edit the z in paperback from Eos as a companion volume to this one—look for it if you enjoy short fantasy fiction, too. But here, we chose science fiction.\n",
      "line is: We try to represent the varieties of tones and voices and attitudes that keep the genre vigorous and responsive to the changing realities out of which it emerges, in science and daily life. This is a book about what's going on now in SF. The stories that follow show, and the story notes point out, the strengths of the evolving genre in the year 2001.\n",
      "line is: Nancy Kress [www.sff.net/people/nankress] is one of today's leading SF writers. She is known for her complex medical SF stories, and for her biological and evolutionary extrapolations in such classics as Beggars in Spain (1993), Beggars and Choosers (1994), and Beggars Ride (1996). In recent years, she has written Maximum Light (1998), Probability Moon (2000), and last year published Probability Sun (2001), the second book in a trilogy of hard SF novels set against the background of a war between humanity and an alien race. In 1998 she married SF writer Charles Sheffield. Her stories are rich in texture and in psychological insight, and have been collected in Trinity and Other Stories (1985), The Aliens of Earth (1993), and Beaker's Dozen (1998). She has won two Nebulas and a Hugo for them, and been nominated a dozen more times. She teaches regularly at summer writing workshops such as Clarion, and during the year at the Bethesda Writing Center in Bethesda, Maryland. She is the Fiction columnist for Writer's Digest.\n",

And yes, she has the power to Charm—to manipulate human emotions and make people see things that aren't there. But that's not very exciting when you're stuck in a small dome house, sleeping every night in a crowded common room with your snoring cousins, spending every day fixing condensers in the hydroponics unit. Min yearns to join the Space Forces like her older brother Jun did—to see the Thousand Worlds and have marvelous adventures!\n",

Unlike other supernaturals, such as dragons, who can control weather, and goblins, who can conjure things out of thin air, fox spirits have a bad reputation. According to the old lore, foxes used to change shape to trick and prey on humans. Min's family wouldn't even consider doing such a thing, but due to lasting prejudice, they have to hide their true nature.\n",

Unfortunately, nobody seems interested in what Min thinks, especially after she knocks the investigator unconscious for insulting her brother's honor. Her family decides to ship her off to the boondocks to keep her out of further trouble, but Min has other ideas. She runs away from home, intent on following Jun to the stars. One young fox spirit, alone against the galaxies, will risk everything to find her brother and discover the mystery of the long-lost Dragon Pearl.\n",

Scrubbing the hydroponics units next to our dome house. Scrounging breakfast from our few sad vegetables and making sure they were seasoned well enough to satisfy my four aunties. Ensuring that the air filters weren't clogged with the dust that got into everything.\n",

      "line is: Studs Lonigan, on the verge of fifteen, and wearing his first suit of long trousers, stood in the bathroom with a Sweet Caporal pasted in his mug. His hands were jammed in his trouser pockets, and he sneered. He puffed, drew the fag out of his mouth, inhaled and said to himself:\n",
      "line is: Studs was a small, broad-shouldered lad. His face was wide and planed; his hair was a light brown. His long nose was too large for his other features; almost a sheeny's nose. His lips were thick and wide, and they did not seem at home on his otherwise frank and boyish face. He was always twisting them into his familiar tough-guy sneers. He had blue eyes; his mother rightly called them baby-blue eyes.\n",
      "line is: The old dump was St. Patrick's grammar school; and St. Patrick's meant a number of things to Studs. It meant school, and school was a jailhouse that might just as well have had barred windows. It meant the long, wide, chalk-smelling room of the seventh- and eighth-grade boys, with its forty or fifty squirming kids. It meant the second floor of the tan brick, undistinguished parish building on Sixty-first Street that had swallowed so much of Studs' life for the past eight years. It meant the black-garbed Sisters of Providence, with their rattling beads, their swishing strides, and the funny-looking wooden clappers they used, which made a dry snapping sound and which hurt like anything when a guy got hit over the head with one. It meant Sister Carmel, who used to teach fourth grade, but was dead now; and who used to hit everybody with the edge of a ruler because she knew they all called her the bearded lady. It meant Studs, twisting in his seat, watching the sun come in the windows to show up the dust on the floor, twisting and squirming, and letting his mind fly to all kinds of places that were not like school. It meant Battleaxe Bertha talking and hearing lessons, her thin, sunken-jawed face white as a ghost, and sometimes looking like a corpse. It meant Bertha yelling in that creaky old woman's voice of hers. It meant Bertha trying to pound lessons down your throat, when you weren't interested in them; church history and all about the Jews and Moses, and Joseph, and Daniel in the lion's den, and Solomon who was wiser than any man that ever lived, except Christ, and maybe the Popes, who had the Holy Ghost to back up what they said; arithmetic, and square and cube roots, and percentage that Studs had never been able to get straight in his bean; cathechism lessons . . . the ten commandments of God, the six commandments of the church, the seven capital sins, and the seven cardinal virtues and that lesson about the sixth commandment, which didn't tell a guy anything at all about it and only had words that he'd found in the dictionary like adultery which made him all the more curious; grammar with all its dry rules, and its sentences that had to be diagrammed and were never diagrammed right; spelling, and words like apothecary that Studs still couldn't spell; Palmer method writing, that was supposed to make you less tired and made you more tired, and the exercises of shaking your arm before each lesson, and the round and round and straight and straight, and the copy book, all smeared with ink, that he had gone through, doing exercise after exercise on neat sheets of Palmer paper so that he could get a Palmer method certificate that his old man kicked about paying for because he thought it was graft; history lessons from the dull red history book, but they wouldn't have been so bad if America had had more wars and if a guy could talk and think about the battles without having to memorize their dates, and the dates of when presidents were elected, and when Fulton invented the steamboat, and Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin or whatever in hell he did invent. School meant Bertha, and Bertha should have been put away long ago, where she could kneel down and pray herself to death, because she was old and crabby and always hauling off on somebody; it was a miracle that a person as old as Bertha could sock as hard or holler as loud as she could; even Sister Bernadette Marie, who was the superior and taught the seventh- and eighth-grade girls in the next room, sometimes had to come in and ask Bertha to make less noise, because she couldn't teach with all the racket going on; but telling Bertha not to shout was like telling a bull that it had no right to see red. And smart guys, like Jim Clayburn, who did his homework every night, couldn't learn much from her. And school meant Dan and Bill Donoghue and Tubby and all the guys in his bunch, and you couldn't find a better gang of guys to pal with this side of Hell. And it meant going to mass in the barn-like church on the first floor, every morning in Lent, and to stations of the cross on Friday afternoons; stations of the cross were always too long unless Father Doneggan said them; and marching on Holy Thursday morning in church with a lily in your hand, and going to communion the third Sunday of every month at the eight o'clock mass with the boys' sodality. It meant goofy young Danny O'Neill, the dippy punk who couldn't be hurt or made cry, no matter how hard he was socked, because his head was made of hard stuff like iron and ivory and marble. It meant Vinc Curley, who had water on the brain, and the doctors must have taken his brains out, drowned and dead like a dead fish, that time they were supposed to have taken a quart of water from his oversized bean. The kids in Vinc's class said that Sister Cyrilla used to pound him on the bean with her clapper, and he'd sit there yelling he was going to tell his mother; and it was funny, and all the kids in the room laughed their guts out. They didn't have 'em as crazy as Vinc in Studs' class; but there was TB McCarthy, who was always getting his ears beat off, and being made to kneel up in front of the room, or to go in Sister Bernadette's room and sit with all the girls and let them laugh at him. And there was Reardon with horses' hoofs for feet. One day in geography in the fifth grade, Cyrilla called on Reardon and asked him what the British Isles consisted of. Reardon didn't know so Studs whispered to him to say iron, and Reardon said iron. Sister Cyrilla thought it was so funny she marked him right for the day's lesson. And St. Patrick's meant Weary Reilley, and Studs hated Weary. He didn't know whether or not he could lick Weary, and Weary was one tough customer, and the guys had been waiting for Studs and Weary to scrap ever since Weary had come to St. Patrick's in the third grade. Studs was a little leery about mixing it with Reilley . . . no, he wasn't . . . it was just . . . well, there was no use starting fights unless you had to . . . and he'd never backed out of a scrap with Weary Reilley or any other guy. And that time he had pasted Weary in the mush with an icy snowball, well, he hadn't backed out of a fight when Weary started getting sore. He had just not meant to hit Weary with it, and in saying so he had only told the truth.\n",
      "line is: St. Patrick's meant a lot of things. St. Patrick's meant . . . Lucy.\n",
      "line is: Lucy Scanlan would stand on the same stage with him in a few hours, and she would receive her diploma. She would wear a white dress, just like his sister Frances, and Weary's sister Fran, and she would receive her diploma. Everybody said that Fran Lonigan and Fran Reilley were the two prettiest girls in the class. Well, if you asked him, the prettiest girl in the class was black-bobbed-haired Lucy.\n",
      "line is: Once when he had been in the sixth grade, he had walked home with Lucy. Now, he puffed his cigarette, and the sneer went off his face. He thought of the March day when he had walked home with her. He had walked home with her. All along Indiana Avenue, he had been liking her, wanting to kiss her. Now, he remembered that day as clearly as if it had just happened. He remembered it better than the day when he was just a punk and he had bashed the living moses out of that smoke who pulled a razor on him over in Carter Playground, and a gang of guys had carried him around on their shoulders, telling him what a great guy he was, and how, when he grew up, he would become the white hope of the world, and lick Jack Johnson for the heavyweight championship. He remembered the day with Lucy, and his memory of it was like having an awful thirst for a drink of clear cold water or a chocolate soda on a hot day. It had been a windy day in March, without any sun. The air had seemed black, and the sky blacker, and all the sun that day had been in his thoughts of her. He had had all kinds of goofy, dizzy feelings that he liked. They had walked home from school, along Indiana Avenue, he and Lucy. They hadn't spoken much, and they had stopped every little while to look at things. They had stopped at the corner of Sixtieth, and he had shown her the basement windows they had broken, just to get even with old Boushwah, the Hunkie janitor, because he always ran them off the grass when they goofed on their way home from school. And she had pretended that it was awful for guys to break windows, when he could see by the look in her eyes that she didn't at all think it so terrible. And they had walked on slow, pigeon-toed slow, slower, so that it would take them a long time to get home. He had carried her books, too, and they had talked about this and that, about the skating season that was just finished, and about the spelling match between the fifth- and sixth-grade boys and girls, where both of them had been spelled down at the first crack of the bat, and they had talked about just talk. When they came to the elevated structure near Fifty-ninth, he had shown her where they played shinny with tin cans, and she said it was a dangerous game, and you were liable to get your shins hurt. Then he had shown her where he had climbed up the girder to the top, just below the elevated tracks, and she had shivered because it was such a dangerous brave thing to do, and he had felt all proud, like a hero, or like Bronco Billy or Eddie Polo in the movies. They had walked home lazy, and he had carried her books, and wished he had the price to buy her candy or a soda, even if it was Lent, and they had stood before the gray brick two-story building where she lived, and he had wanted, as the devil wants souls, to kiss her, and he hadn't wanted to leave her because when he did he knew the day would get blacker, and he would feel like he did when he had been just out of his diapers and he used to be afraid of the night. There had been something about that day. He had gone on in school, wishing and wishing for another one like it to come along. And now he felt it all over again, the goofy, dizzy, flowing feelings it had given him.\n",
      "line is: He wanted to stand there, and think about Lucy, wondering if he would ever have days with her like that one, wondering how much he'd see of her after she went to high school. And he goddamned himself, because he was getting soft. He was Studs Lonigan, a guy who didn't have mushy feelings! He was a hard-boiled egg that they had left in the pot a couple of hours too long.\n",
      "line is: He faced the mirror, and stuck the fag in the right-hand corner of his mouth. He looked tough and sneered. Then he let the cigarette hang from the left side. He studied himself with satisfaction. He placed the cigarette in the center of his puss, and put on a weak-kneed expression. He took the cigarette out of his mouth, daintily, barely holding it between his thumb and first finger, and he pretended that he was a grown-up mama's boy, smoking for the first time. He said to himself:\n",
      "line is: He didn't know that he bowed his head when he muttered the Lord's name, just as Sister Cyrilla had always taught them to do. He took a vicious poke at the air, as if he were letting one fly at a mama's boy.\n",
      "line is: He stuck the fag back in his mouth and looked like Studs Lonigan was supposed to look. He lowered the lid on the toilet seat, and sat down to think. He puffed at his cigarette, and flicked the ashes in the sink.\n",
      "line is: \"Get out of my way, Fritzie . . . Get out of my way . . . Please . . . And mother . . . Mother! MOTHER! . . . Will you come here, please . . .

Walkin always walkin. Mum an Jon with damp cloth over their mouths an she got the proper mask bein the little wun. Kept dust out sum but she still spat pale red. Out to the soaks and rockholes takin the plastic bottles. Check the traps, dig for roots and grubs, set up the sun stills lest the soaks come up dry. Then she an Jon set to scav an scav an scav. The near hulks had been stripped long ago an what mighta once been shacks was just shapes on the ground that came an went in the storms, old things lost to dust. Evry now an then though they found a spring or sum bit of plastic that were worth sumthin to the traders headed to the big camp. Screws were good, bolts better. They was buildin things thattaway. Walls an such the scavs said. Had a powerful need for things dug up an found. They was thirstin for bits of the old, whatever them fellas could get their hands on. Copper an steel were worth plenny. Salt an grub. They picked an picked. Were the ruin of an old farmhouse still standin a mile distant but it were a bad place an stripped clean anyways. More hulks out in the dunes, plenny of treasure left to find. Rust were slow in the long dry. Them sand scarred monsters from the old times still looked alright on the inside sumtimes. Now an then they still had fellas inside but most often they was stripped bare. Bones was good for carvin. Bone handles an bone knives. Leg bones the strongest. She an him knew where the good wuns was. Dint tell Mum evrythin he dint. Jon always made sure she brought home sumthin even when she dint find it herself. Out there an fetch me back what ya find. Make yerself useful. Evrywun's gotta have a reason her mum said but she knew she were alright. Mum, thin as a whip, bones standin stark against the sundarked skin. Only pretend hard. Lean, muscle like braided wire an the same dark blue, opalchip eyes she got told she had herself.\n",
      "line is: Mum found soaks an water for the scavs an told em what was comin in their days ahead. Told the futures of them what came tradin through on their way to the big camp, the place where they was puttin a system in place. Told em good enough that plenny come back, askin what the next season held, where they might comb the sand an cracked salt lakes for fortune. Plenny to be made outta things from the old before. Sum of them scavs had been comin their way for years, droppin little presents for their mum an her brood when the haul was good. Only pretend hard her mum was, she still stroked her hair till she slept when the night terrors and whirrwhirrs were on her. She listened in on what the scavs told her mum. Gettin harder they reckoned, hadta go ever deeper, ever darker for them things from the before. Sum went out an never come back. Down the deep dark they said, things you din wanna wake. Fear comin off em like stink as they told their tellins over the fire.\n",
      "line is: They was just comin back in from the hills, the mallee standin stark and black at their backs. Heatstained sky spite the droppin sun. Sweat beadin on her lip inside the mask. Pockets fulla wire an a coupla long black rubber strips that werent cracked too bad. She went in with water an Jon put the billy over flame an went to get their mum. She int emptied her pockets fore he were back comin in the door at a run. The sun low in the west an the shadows cast long. No mistakin what he was sayin, breathless an pale, eyes standin out sharp against his skin, hair the red of dust. It were their hour, wun of their hours.\n",
      "line is: Werent no need to ask who. He'd come barrelin through the skin hangin across the entrance, an Mum were on his heels. Eyes wide, the whites bigger than she'd ever seen, sumthin stuck in her head she always wished she'd forget. There was only wun big space inside, no way out, no place to go. Mum pulled aside the mat on the hard packed floor, an openin in the dust that might be big enough for wun small kid, but only wun. She picked her up, lookin her hard in the eyes. The same eyes she got told she had. Her mums lips was pressed together in a white line, the cords in her skinny neck standin out an her fingers leavin bruises that was gunna outlive her. Her ma let go of her arm for a second, held her finger over her lips and and then laid her in the shallow hole, holdin her eye all the way down. Coverin her with rags, hands movin fast then pushin her down deeper.\n",
      "line is: Now the light went dim, the mat pulled back over her an her mum flingin handfuls of dust over it, buryin her in the floor, tryna cover evry trace. Mums last words in her ears fadin, just the sound of her own hammerin chest. She lay like a dead thing in the dark, an she figgered she was, knees drawn up to her chin, wun balled fist in her mouth, tryin not to shake. All too fast to follow. There were no heavy footfall, if stories was true them that was comin moved on bare feet an claw, teeth like long knives. Or mayhap were it boots of skin, bark and leather, movin like shadows over the floor of the desert, silent in the arvo haze with blades drawn, nuthin needin to be spoke.\n",
      "line is: Ghostmen. Out the dark men. Blademen, badmen, bludthings. Reckoner. All them names.\n",
      "line is: Whisperin names. Why? Shut up. Teeth chatterin. Could hear her brother an ma had gone out back into the open, both shoutin from a ways off, nuthin she could unnerstand. Her ma cryin out an noises of struggle, her brother's screamin wail that turned her blud cold. She lay still in the hole, she closed her eyes an ears.\n",
      "line is: When she woke she couldnt move a long time. She was cold with her own water that she'd let go all over herself. She dint remember doin it. Her knees was stuck an she pushed the rags aside an lifted a corner of the mat slow, dust drainin in onto her. There were no light, it were long dark. She couldnt hear anythin and pushed her way through the cloth, through the ache in her head behind her eye. She sat up painful from the shallow grave that werent wun an she could see starlight through the door. The skin were gone an the stark sand stared back at her through the empty frame. It were cold like it never were and dead quiet. She climbed out of the hole further, crawlin towards the outside, her fingers stickin to sumthin pooled on the sand. She knew not to cry out. By the stars she saw the shack was wrecked but not stripped. Them what had come barely cared for the dry snakemeat and hoarded oil an wood. The saved water was gone but the watercatcher were in wun piece and the dust were littered with bones barely cleaned. Sheaves of grass still restin in the corner like they always was. When she looked at em it were like nuthin had changed. From the door she could see the plain. There was no firelight, no camp close by. They come outta dust an went back to it. On the sand she saw more dark patches reflected in the starlight, sticky to touch. On small legs she tripped out into the dirt, feet bare, the silence louder than the noise in her head. She walked a ways into the sand an then lay down on her side facin the shack, seein the night clear through it, straight through the broken walls. Whisperin, the fear on her. Thinkin they were out there watchin, knowin they'd missed her, turnin around right now an comin back for seconds.\n",
      "line is: She knew blud, she knew the Ghosts had come, the maras and sleep terrors had told her they would come. Mum hadnt kept the fear from her neither. The longer she lay there starin out into the dark the more she thought there was nuthin real strange about this except that she was still breathin an her ma an brother werent. Ghostet they was. Et by them things from the dark. Breath caught in her chest an she forced it back down so she dint let a howl go an give herself away. Her eyes dropped to the stuff that had been dragged out of the shack. Skins an jars thatd held bolts an screws, both empty. Scraps of steel an the rubber they'd brought back that afternoon. She looked through the shack at the frozen dunes an nuthin moved.\n",
      "line is: He were in a foul mood this mornin. Another wun dead. Another wun taken out to the big burn pits where the waste turned into smoke. Smell of flesh an garbage crowdin him. Shoulda been used to it by now. Where did they find em? In this bludy place where there werent hardly any kids anyway they still managed to find a few an he was always buyin the weak wuns, a knack for pickin up yungens what was on their last legs. This fucken land. Dint have no name he knew of. Had been a desert since theyd started makin memories. Fucken Glows an fucken scavs an fucken cornerboys. He picked up the pace towards the middle, the boss was gunna come soon. The circles was quiet this time of day, that was sum small blessing, an the heat was workin its way up, sun still low enough to just be drawin a faint sweat. His feet scuffed over the dusty concrete, sendin up small red clouds. The shacks an sheds he passed was cobbled outta sheet iron and hessian. Scraps of wood an bits of hulk stitched together with tarp an rope into blind monsters. Heads of sleepers an drinkers an sniffers an smokers wakin bleary an sum not wakin at all. Sum what couldnt be bothered walkin to the well or the nearest soak was stumblin out back of their camps, he could see em. Collectin the water from under plastic scraps, pissin in the ash of last nights fire. Rubbish of bleached plastic and bone heaped around the doorways. Charms an icons, wheels an knives, all small and brittle. Precious few yungens an even less old. He passed em, roundin the curve of the big Circle. The System. He spat on the ground. Down the cuts he could see halfway across the ring road that looped all around the inside the wall, breakin only at the tyres built around the old water tower an pickin up again on the other side of them grim dusty stacks. They was the only things that stood taller than the leftovers, the fibro barracks half fallen in and ironroofed sheds in the middle. Stripped hulks an old concrete channels leadin nowhere. Leavebehinds that werent doin nowun no good. He turned down the hook, headin straight through the circles now on the new cut, seein the first of the hungry cornerboys wakin but they all knew who his boss was an better than to try anythin. Yeah keep yerselves to yerselves, he eyed them off an they kept his gaze, hands in their short pockets, sum of em swingin a careless verse back an forth between themselves, wakin slow. He were startin to sweat now, had been walkin a hot minute or so. His hands was damp an he patted his pocket again, feelin the shavings of gold wrapped in a plastic scrap through the cloth, wonderin if anywun would take em or if it was back to the Old Mans place for barter. Medicine, gold, clear wine, never knew what the scavs took these days. Whatever they could get their hands on the thick bastards, thinkin they was sumthin special. Werent nuthin to him, fools takin chances outside the walls, but he knew the Old Man kept em close. He cleared dust out of his throat, hackin hard. All the time wonderin what was gunna get brought in, if there was gunna be anythin up on the block that the Old Man would wanna take a look at. He hoped not. Was done choosin bad cattle.\n",
      "line is: They knew his face, knew that he'd be callin his numbers usin the hands, that he werent gunna be yellin anythin in a hurry, now or ever. That was well an good, more than a few silent faces in the System. When the boss showed up finally an watched two fellas go past on the block they knew he werent gunna be callin out either. Just left it to Karra. Hands was no good in a cipher but they was plenny fine for makin trades an whippin curs. Now the sun were up the heat were chokin, makin evry breath burn in his chest an even the little heeltoe steps of the sellers an buyers was draggin up enough dust to start sum other fella coughin in the back. Werent no moren forty blokes, just a quiet mornin, movin weight of wire, cloth an iron. Sum sellin old books but nowun was buyin. Usually rubbish these days, all the farmin an smithin an diggin books was long gone, hidden away. They was more story than anythin else anyway Karra reckoned. Werent nowun growin much out here. Werent the tools for smithin neither. Place were a fucken blight. What they had to go by was what was in their heads, for a long time now. What they had to trade was what they made or hunted or scavved an dust knew things was gettin harder out on the sand. All things even better to be in here than out there he reckoned. He remembered the walls goin up not that long ago, shitty things they was. Piled em around the Stacks an them tyres was gunna be more trouble than they was worth, mark him. He moved the stump of his tongue around in his mouth, workin sum moisture into the back of his throat as a yungen was dragged up onto the block by a rope collar. He could feel the boss straighten up an peer at the kid. Looked like a bag of bones but at least she had both her arms an legs. The scav what brought her pulled her up by the throat an her hands went quick to her neck as she got throttled. She kicked, showin them buyin that she could move. He dropped her back down hard on the packed ground but she dint cry out. Sumwun from over his shoulder spoke up.\n",

      "line is: Long before they were ever written down, poems were organized in lines. Since the invention of the printing press, readers have become increasingly conscious of looking at poems, rather than hearing them, but the function of the poetic line remains primarily sonic. Whether a poem is written in meter or in free verse, the lines introduce some kind of pattern into the ongoing syntax of the poem's sentences; the lines make us experience those sentences differently. Reading a prose poem, we feel the strategic absence of line.\n",
      "line is: But precisely because we've become so used to looking at poems, the function of line can be hard to describe. As James Longenbach writes in _The Art of the Poetic Line_ , \"Line has no identity except in relation to other elements in the poem, especially the syntax of the poem's sentences. It is not an abstract concept, and its qualities cannot be described generally or schematically. It cannot be associated reliably with the way we speak or breathe. Nor can its function be understood merely from its visual appearance on the page.\" Printed books altered our relationship to poetry by allowing us to see the lines more readily. What new challenges do electronic reading devices pose?\n",
      "line is: In a printed book, the width of the page and the size of the type are fixed. Usually, because the page is wide enough and the type small enough, a line of poetry fits comfortably on the page: What you see is what you're supposed to hear as a unit of sound. Sometimes, however, a long line may exceed the width of the page; the line continues, indented just below the beginning of the line. Readers of printed books have become accustomed to this convention, even if it may on some occasions seem ambiguous—particularly when some of the lines of a poem are already indented from the left-hand margin of the page.\n",
      "line is: But unlike a printed book, which is stable, an ebook is a shape-shifter. Electronic type may be reflowed across a galaxy of applications and interfaces, across a variety of screens, from phone to tablet to computer. And because the reader of an ebook is empowered to change the size of the type, a poem's original lineation may seem to be altered in many different ways. As the size of the type increases, the likelihood of any given line running over increases.\n",
      "line is: Our typesetting standard for poetry is designed to register that when a line of poetry exceeds the width of the screen, the resulting run-over line should be indented, as it might be in a printed book. Take a look at John Ashbery's \"Disclaimer\" as it appears in two different type sizes.\n",
      "line is: Each of these versions of the poem has the same number of lines: the number that Ashbery intended. But if you look at the second, third, and fifth lines of the second stanza in the right-hand version of \"Disclaimer,\" you'll see the automatic indent; in the fifth line, for instance, the word _ahead_ drops down and is indented. The automatic indent not only makes poems easier to read electronically; it also helps to retain the rhythmic shape of the line—the unit of sound—as the poet intended it. And to preserve the integrity of the line, words are never broken or hyphenated when the line must run over. Reading \"Disclaimer\" on the screen, you can be sure that the phrase \"you pause before the little bridge, sigh, and turn ahead\" is a complete line, while the phrase \"you pause before the little bridge, sigh, and turn\" is not.\n",
      "line is: Open Road has adopted an electronic typesetting standard for poetry that ensures the clearest possible marking of both line breaks and stanza breaks, while at the same time handling the built-in function for resizing and reflowing text that all ereading devices possess. The first step is the appropriate semantic markup of the text, in which the formal elements distinguishing a poem, including lines, stanzas, and degrees of indentation, are tagged. Next, a style sheet that reads these tags must be designed, so that the formal elements of the poems are always displayed consistently. For instance, the style sheet reads the tags marking lines that the author himself has indented; should that indented line exceed the character capacity of a screen, the run-over part of the line will be indented further, and all such runovers will look the same. This combination of appropriate coding choices and style sheets makes it easy to display poems with complex indentations, no matter if the lines are metered or free, end-stopped or enjambed.\n",
      "line is: Ultimately, there may be no way to account for every single variation in the way in which the lines of a poem are disposed visually on an electronic reading device, just as rare variations may challenge the conventions of the printed page, but with rigorous quality assessment and scrupulous proofreading, nearly every poem can be set electronically in accordance with its author's intention. And in some regards, electronic typesetting increases our capacity to transcribe a poem accurately: In a printed book, there may be no way to distinguish a stanza break from a page break, but with an ereader, one has only to resize the text in question to discover if a break at the bottom of a page is intentional or accidental.\n",
      "line is: Our goal in bringing out poetry in fully reflowable digital editions is to honor the sanctity of line and stanza as meticulously as possible—to allow readers to feel assured that the way the lines appear on the screen is an accurate embodiment of the way the author wants the lines to sound. Ever since poems began to be written down, the manner in which they ought to be written down has seemed equivocal; ambiguities have always resulted. By taking advantage of the technologies available in our time, our goal is to deliver the most satisfying reading experience possible.\n",
      "line is: to be served to us. Why do I tell you these things?\n",
      "line is: In town it was very urban but in the country cows were covering the hills. The clouds were near and very moist. I was walking along the pavement with Anna, enjoying the scattered scenery. Suddenly a sound like a deep bell came from behind us. We both turned to look. \"It's the words you spoke in the past, coming back to haunt you,\" Anna explained. \"They always do, you know.\"\n",

      "line is: IN 1949 THE SMOKEJUMPERS were not far from their origins as parachute jumpers turned stunt performers dropping from the wings of planes at county fairs just for the hell of it plus a few dollars, less hospital expenses. By this time they were also sure they were the best firefighters in the United States Forest Service, and although by now they were very good, especially against certain kinds of fires, they should have stopped to realize that they were newcomers in this ancient business of fighting forest fires. It was 1940 when the first parachute jump on a forest fire was made and a year later that the Smokejumpers were organized, so only for nine years had there been a profession with the aim of taking on at the same time three of the four elements of the universe--air, earth, and fire--and in a simple continuous act dropping out of the sky and landing in a treetop or on the face of a cliff in order to make good their boast of digging a trench around every fire they landed on by ten o'clock the next morning. In 1949 the Smokejumpers were still so young that they referred affectionately to all fires they jumped on as \"ten o'clock fires,\" as if they already had them under control before they jumped. They were still so young they hadn't learned to count the odds and to sense they might owe the universe a tragedy.\n",
      "line is: It is true, though, that no technical advance was to influence the Forest Service's methods of spotting and fighting wildfires as much as the airplane, which arrived early in the century about the same time as the Forest Service (1905). Two world wars hastened the union between airplanes and fire-fighting.  By 1917 chief forester Henry S. Graves was conferring with the chief of the Army Air Corps about the possibility of army planes flying patrol missions over western forests. By 1925 the Forest Service itself started using planes from which fires could be spotted more quickly and thoroughly than from scattered lookouts. By 1929 planes were dropping supplies to firefighters, and it seemed that soon firefighters themselves would be dropped, but psychological difficulties and difficulties with equipment held back the development of parachute jumping on wildfires. It was only after several years of experimenting and training that the first parachute jump on a forest fire was made, one of the two jumpers being Earl Cooley, who was to be the spotter on the C-47 that carried the Smoke-jumpers to the Mann Gulch fire and, as spotter, tapped each jumper on the left calf as the signal to step into the sky over Mann Gulch.\n",
      "line is: The chief psychological roadblock holding up the acceptance of parachute jumping by the government and the public itself was the belief that most parachute jumpers were at least a little bit nuts and the high probability that a few of them were. In 1935, Evan Kelley, of the Forest Service's Region One (with headquarters in Missoula, Montana, where in a few years one of the biggest Smokejumper bases was to be established), rejected the possibility of dropping men on fires from parachutes by saying: \"The best information I can get from experienced fliers is that all parachute jumpers are more or less crazy--just a little bit unbalanced, otherwise they wouldn't be engaged in such a hazardous undertaking.\" There is no doubt that among those most visibly touched with the Icarus complex were jumpers off wings of planes at county fairs or stunt-men doing the same kind of work for movies. Only a year before Kelley had made his psychological analysis of parachute jumpers, Frank Derry, a stuntman in California and short of cash, got the idea of jumping from a plane in a parachute, dressed as Santa Claus. He made a perfect landing, pleased the local Los Angeles merchants, quit factory work for good, joined a flying circus barnstorming the West, and became  one of the nine original Forest Service Smokejumpers, one of the Forest Service's finest jump instructors, and one of its best riggers, making important improvements in both the parachute and the jump suit.\n",
      "line is: Most people have a touch of the Icarus complex and, like Smokejumpers, wish to appear on earth from the sky. In my home town of Missoula, Montana, older brothers all over town trained their younger brothers to jump from garage roofs, using gunnysacks for parachutes. The older brothers argued that the younger brothers should do the jumping because, being smaller, they would take longer to reach the ground and so give their gunnysacks more time to open and soften the landing. From the start, Smokejumpers had to have a lot of what we have a little of, and one way all men are born equal is in being born at least a little bit crazy, some being more equal than others. A number of these latter were needed to get the Smokejumpers started, and a certain number more have always been needed to keep it going.\n",
      "line is: Fortunately, many of those powered by the Icarus complex, unlike Icarus, are gifted mechanically in odd ways and have long worked on problems connected with landing safely. Even the most sublime of oddballs, Leonardo da Vinci, had studied the problem of safely landing men on earth from the sky. But it wasn't until 1783 that the French physicist Louis-Sebastien Lenormand made the first successful parachute jump from a tower, and even in 1930 the parachute had many shortcomings as a means of aerial transport, some of which were eliminated or reduced by none other than Frank Derry, the Santa Claus parachute jumper who was also gifted mechanically. One of the parachute's greatest shortcomings as aerial transport had been that, being a parabolic object, it drops with a bell-like motion. As it descends, air is forced up into it and, since there are no openings in the parachute through which the air can escape, it rocks up on one side until the surplus air is released, then swings to the other side until it tips out the excess air it has accumulated on its return trip. As a result, before the parachute could be a reasonably safe  means of getting from the sky to the earth, the rocking had to be taken out of its flight and some means of steering it had to be devised so Smokejumpers and their supplies could be dropped on a designated spot near a fire instead of scattered all over the nearby mountains.\n",
      "line is: The parachute developed by Frank Derry became the standard Smokejumpers' parachute for many years and is the parachute used by the crew that dropped on the Mann Gulch fire. The rocking motion had been reduced by three openings through which air could be released--an opening in the top and two slots on opposite sides. On the outside of the chute attached to the slots were \"tails,\" pieces of nylon that acted as rudders to guide the flow of air coming through the slots, and to them guide lines were attached so that the direction of the flight was ultimately determined by the jumper. Not a highly safe and sensitive piece of machinery, but better than Icarus had. It had a speed of seven or eight knots, and, as soon as a jumper could, he turned his face to the wind and looked over his shoulder to see, among other things, that he didn't smash into a cliff.\n",
      "line is: Frank Derry, his two brothers, and others of the early Smokejumpers not only greatly improved the parachute but soon were developing a safer jump suit, one designed especially for jumping in mountainous timber country--football helmet with heavy wire-mesh face mask, felt-lined suit, and \"shock absorbers\" such as ankle braces, athletic supporters, back and abdominal braces, and heavy logger boots (the White logger boots from Spokane, Washington, the best). Frank Derry's two brothers were helpful, but staying put was not part of their calling and they weren't long with the Smokejumpers. Frank, however, lasted much longer, then bought a bar nearby and became his own best customer.\n",
      "line is: So far it has all been the jump in smokejumping and nothing about the smoke or fire at the end. In 1949 a fair number of old-timers in the Forest Service still believed that God means there to be only one honest way to get to a forest fire and that is to walk your guts out. To these old-timers  the Smokejumpers were from a circus sideshow, although in fact they were already on their way to becoming the best firefighting outfit in the Forest Service.\n",
      "line is: Basic movements in the history of the Forest Service had helped put the Smokejumpers by 1949 on their way to being the best. The United States Forest Service was officially established in 1905 by President Theodore Roosevelt and Governor Gifford Pinchot of Pennsylvania, eastern outdoorsmen who knew and loved the earth in its wondrous ways when left to itself and given a chance. Their policy of acquiring and protecting some of the earth's most beautiful remaining parts became the Forest Service's primary purpose. Then came 1910, the most disastrous fire year on record. In western Montana and Idaho 3 million acres were left behind as charred trees and ashes that rose when you walked by, then blew away when you passed. This transformation occurred largely in two days, August 20 and 21, when thousands of people thought the world was coming to an end, and for eighty-seven people it did.\n",
      "line is: I remember these two days very well. My family was on summer vacation, camped in tents on an island between forks of the Bitterroot River. The elders in my father's church had become alarmed and had come in a wagon to rescue us. A team of the elders waded out to our island, crossed hands, and in this cradle carried my mother back to the wagon. My father and I followed, my father holding me with one hand and his fishing rod with the other and I also holding my fishing rod with my other hand. It was frightening, as what seemed to be great flakes of white snow were swirling to the ground in the heat and darkness of high noon. I was seven years old and might have cried for our tent, which we had to leave behind, except I thought my mother and our two rods would make it to the wagon.\n",
      "line is: Since 1910, much of the history of the Forest Service can be translated into a succession of efforts to get firefighters on fires as soon as possible--the sooner, the smaller the fire. If a campfire left burning can be caught soon enough, a man with  a shovel can bury it. If the fire is a lightning fire burning in a dead tree, a man will need an ax to drop the burning tree and will still need the shovel to dig the shallow trench into which he is going to drop and bury it. If two Smokejumpers had reached the Mann Gulch fire the afternoon it started, they would at least have kept it under control until a larger crew arrived. Before the Mann Gulch fire was finally put under control five days later, there were 450 men on it and they didn't have as much to do with stopping it as did cliffs and rock slides.\n",

      "line is: Welcome to life as a yoga girl! Or yoga boy, for that matter. Yoga is a practice for anyone and everyone, and I'm here to share with you the big secret of finding success and balance in your life, yogi style.\n",
      "line is: The secret is, there is none. There is no grand recipe for a perfect life. In today's fast-paced society we often find ourselves looking for a quick fix, the next big thing to make us feel better, which is why we see new health trends and diets taking the world by storm every other week. I am not here to announce the newest weight-loss technique or to tell you that you should be eating fewer carbs or more carbs or no carbs (ah, that's it!) or whatever fad is hitting the Internet this morning. I am not here to tell you to change your life so that you can be better.\n",
      "line is: I'm here to tell you you are good enough the way you already are.\n",
      "line is: Shocking, I know. Even though we are a decade and a half into the twenty-first century, sending people to the moon on vacation and connecting through the virtual world in more ways than ever before, there is still a fundamental flaw in how we treat one another, and most of all, in how we treat ourselves. We do not love ourselves enough. We run around trying to find ways to change our bodies, our health, our love lives, our work—anything to make us feel whole and happy. But the faster we run, the faster we miss the point. We all search for balance, but finding this does not lie in the latest health trend. Balance comes from slowing down, from taking deep breaths, from understanding your body and what it needs. It comes from accepting who you are and loving yourself every step of the way.\n",
      "line is: For me, yoga was the way to get there. Although yoga is a practice that has been around for more than five thousand years, it's well adapted to the culture we live in and it's getting more popular every day. The world of yoga is so full of different styles, teachers, classes, online videos, and gadgets these days that it can be hard to navigate. My aim with this book is to give you an idea of what life as a yogi can entail, and to help you get back to the root of the practice: creating moments of silence. These moments are when the real breakthroughs happen, when we come back to our priorities, our focus, and the love we have for ourselves and the people around us. Yoga involves much more than physical poses practiced on a yoga mat. In fact, there are beautiful ways to use what we learn from this practice and bring it out into the world. I hope to inspire you to be the best you can be, and to accept and embrace every single aspect of what that means.\n",
      "line is: I firmly believe that real change and true happiness come from acceptance. Accepting our bodies, accepting who we are, and accepting the situation we are in. Many of the insecurities we struggle with daily come from thinking that things should be different from reality.\n",
      "line is: We live in a society that continuously harps on everything that we should change in our lives. We need to improve, do better, look better, feel better. We should lose weight, gain muscle, eat healthier, get better jobs, buy nicer clothes, get shinier hair, earn more money. Only rarely are we told that we are good enough just the way we are.\n",
      "line is: There is a big difference between genuinely wanting to change something about our way of life and feeling that we need to change because we have to alter who we are in order to be accepted and fit in. Where do you live on that spectrum? And what is it you are looking to change? If you are like most people, there are probably many things you'd like to see different in your life. My question is why. Throughout your life, who has told you that you are not good enough? Where did you get the idea? Most of the time the judgments we feel come from no one other than ourselves. No one judges you the way you do. When it comes to creating a happy, healthy life, we need to start from the right place. No matter what you want to change in your life—lose weight, de-stress, build a career—it needs to come from a place of genuine intention.\n",
      "line is: We can make changes in our lives based on love or on fear. Do you want to lose ten pounds because you know it would be good for your heart and you'd feel so much better? Or do you want to lose ten pounds so you'll fit into your skinny jeans and look better in a bikini? Maybe the answer is all of the above, but there is a very real difference between them. True, lasting, effortless change comes from taking action from a place of love. From the heart. Does your heart give a damn about what you look like in a bikini? I highly doubt that. However, it probably does cares about your ability to move freely, to be strong, and to feel healthy.\n",
      "line is: Caring for our well-being has to start from within, and this is also one of the most important foundations of the yoga practice. We need to direct our attention inward and connect to the breath. Focusing on our breath keeps us present, calms the mind, and allows us to develop the awareness of the body we need to practice with care and compassion. If we are not fully present, we are no longer practicing yoga but are simply doing exercises and stretches on a yoga mat. Cultivating this awareness begins with the breath and is what eventually turns our chattering minds into quiet places for contemplation and acceptance.\n",
      "line is: Take time either right before or right after your practice to sit in silence for a few moments. Set your intentions for the day, breathe deeply, and take a minute to extend gratitude to all of the beautiful things you have in your life. Bow your head to the earth. This is a small gesture of reverence and gratitude that helps us look within and direct our attention toward the happiness we have in life. After my practice I always drink a big green smoothie or a large green juice before heading out to embrace whatever life has in store for me that day.\n",

      "line is: Henry's second novel, written, like his first, under a pen name, had done well. It had won prizes and was translated into dozens of languages. Henry was invited to book launches and literary festivals around the world; countless schools and book clubs adopted the book; he regularly saw people reading it on planes and trains; Hollywood was set to turn it into a movie; and so on and so forth.\n",
      "line is: Henry continued to live what was essentially a normal, anonymous life. Writers seldom become public figures. It's their books that rightly hog all the publicity. Readers will easily recognize the cover of a book they've read, but in a café that man over there, is that... is that... well, it's hard to tell—doesn't he have long hair?—oh, he's gone.\n",
      "line is: When he was recognized, Henry didn't mind. In his experience, the encounter with a reader was a pleasure. After all, they'd read his book and it had an impact, otherwise why would they come up to him? The meeting had an intimate quality; two strangers were coming together, but to discuss an external matter, a faith object that had moved them both, so all barriers fell. This was no place for lies or bombast. Voices were quiet; bodies leaned close together; selves were revealed. Sometimes personal confessions were made. One reader told Henry he'd read the novel in prison. Another that she'd read it while battling cancer. A father shared that his family had read it aloud in the aftermath of the premature birth and eventual death of their baby. And there were other such encounters. In each case, an element of his novel—a line, a character, an incident, a symbol—had helped them pull through a crisis in their lives. Some of the readers Henry met became quite emotional. This never failed to affect him and he tried his best to respond in a manner that soothed them.\n",
      "line is: In the more typical encounters, readers simply wanted to express their appreciation and admiration, now and again accompanied by a material token, a present made or bought: a snapshot, a bookmark, a book. They might have a question or two they hoped to ask, timidly, not meaning to bother. They were grateful for whatever answer he might give. They took the book he signed and held it to their chest with both hands. The bolder ones, usually but not always teenagers, sometimes asked if they could have their picture taken with him. Henry would stand, an arm over their shoulders, smiling at the camera.\n",
      "line is: Readers walked away, their faces lit up because they'd met him, while his was lit up because he'd met them. Henry had written a novel because there was a hole in him that needed filling, a question that needed answering, a patch of canvas that needed painting—that blend of anxiety, curiosity and joy that is at the origin of art—and he had filled the hole, answered the question, splashed colour on the canvas, all done for himself, because he had to. Then complete strangers told him that his book had filled a hole in them, had answered a question, had brought colour to their lives. The comfort of strangers, be it a smile, a pat on the shoulder or a word of praise, is truly a comfort.\n",
      "line is: As for fame, fame felt like nothing. Fame was not a sensation like love or hunger or loneliness, welling from within and invisible to the outside eye. It was rather entirely external, coming from the minds of others. It existed in the way people looked at him or behaved towards him. In that, being famous was no different from being gay, or Jewish, or from a visible minority: you are who you are, and then people project onto you some notion they have. Henry was essentially unchanged by the success of his novel. He was the same person he had been before, with the same strengths and the same weaknesses. On the rare occasions when he was approached by a reader in a disagreeable way, he had the last weapon of the writer working under a pseudonym: no, he wasn't XXX, he was just a guy named Henry.\n",
      "line is: Eventually the business of personally promoting his novel died down, and Henry returned to an existence where he could sit quietly in a room for weeks and months on end. He wrote another book. It involved five years of thinking, researching, writing, and rewriting. The fate of that book is not immaterial to what happened next to Henry, so it bears being described.\n",
      "line is: The book Henry wrote was in two parts, and he intended them to be published in what the publishing trade calls a flip book: that is, a book with two sets of distinct pages that are attached to a common spine upside down and back-to-back to each other. If you flick your thumb through a flip book, the pages, halfway along, will appear upside down. A head-to-tails flip of the conjoined book will bring you to its fraternal twin. So the name _flip book_.\n",
      "line is: Henry chose this unusual format because he was concerned with how best to present two literary wares that shared the same title, the same theme, the same concern, but not the same method. He'd in fact written two books: one was a novel, while the other was a piece of nonfiction, an essay. He had taken this double approach because he felt he needed every means at his disposal to tackle his chosen subject. But fiction and nonfiction are very rarely published in the same book. That was the hitch. Tradition holds that the two must be kept apart. That is how our knowledge and impressions of life are sorted in bookstores and libraries—separate aisles, separate floors—and that is how publishers prepare their books, imagination in one package, reason in another. It's not how writers write. A novel is not an entirely unreasonable creation, nor is an essay devoid of imagination. Nor is it how people live. People don't so rigorously separate the imaginative from the rational in their thinking and in their actions. There are truths and there are lies—these are the transcendent categories, in books as in life. The useful division is between the fiction and nonfiction that speaks the truth and the fiction and nonfiction that utters lies.\n",
      "line is: Still, the custom, a set way of thinking, posed a problem, Henry realized. If his novel and essay were published separately, as two books, their complementarity would not be so evident and their synergy would likely be lost. They had to be published together. But in what order? The idea of placing the essay before the novel struck Henry as unacceptable. Fiction, being closer to the full experience of life, should take precedence over nonfiction. Stories—individual stories, family stories, national stories—are what stitch together the disparate elements of human existence into a coherent whole. We are story animals. It would not be fitting to place such a grand expression of our being behind a more limited act of exploratory reasoning. But behind serious nonfiction lies the same fact and preoccupation as behind fiction—of being human and what it means—so why should the essay be slotted as an afterword?\n",
      "line is: Regardless of meritorious status, if novel and essay were published in a sequence in one book, whichever came first would inevitably cast into shadow whichever came second.\n",

I wasn't sure what was subdued about it. She'd taken an electric blue ready-made boxystyle blazer and added kelly green and fuchsia crocheted trim around the neck, down the front and at the cuffs. \"Pink, you dropped your snowflake.\" When I turned, she was holding out the ball of white thread, my steel hook and what appeared to be a tangle of the fine yarn. She glanced around. \"Maybe I better stay here with you.\" I shook my head and gestured back toward the car. I didn't know what was going on, but I did know I didn't want to have Adele in the middle of it. She hung her head as I got my suitcase out of the trunk. \"Pink, I've been your backup before. C'mon, let me be part of the action.\" When I pointed toward the car again, she went into a full pout, but she finally got back into the new Matrix station wagon and drove off.\n",
      "line is: Adele and I were just returning from our trip to San Diego, which Adele kept referring to as a yarn emergency. Since our crochet group, the Tarzana Hookers, had become so connected with the bookstore where I worked, one of the co-owners, Mrs. Shedd, had recently added a yarn department to the store. It was still a work-in-progress because Mrs. Shedd wanted the yarn we sold to be special and high-end rather than what was sold at the big craft stores. When she heard about a yarn store closing in San Diego and selling off their stock, Mrs. Shedd had sent us down there at the last minute.\n",
      "line is: It was just the high-end unusual stuff we were looking for, and we had packed the back of Adele's wagon solid with yarn. The rest was being UPSed up to us. Adding the new yarn section was good and bad. Good that we were getting all this wonderful yarn, and bad because everything at the bookstore was already on overdrive due to the upcoming holidays and our big launch event. Now we had more work than ever.\n",
      "line is: \"Did you find the body?\" one of the uniforms asked when Barry returned a few moments later.\n",
      "line is: I tried again to talk to the uniform, but he was impassive. That was when Barry saw me. When he's working, he usually has a neutral expression, but now his whole face relaxed and his breath came out in a gush as he crossed the space between us. Then his expression changed from relief to a mixture of surprise and annoyance.\n",

      "line is: _Love, satisfaction, trouble, death, pleasure, work, sex, memory, celebration, hunger, desire, loss, laughter, even salvation_ : to all these things food can provide a prelude; or comfort after; and sometimes a handy substitute for. It often seems food is a metaphor for most anything, from justice to joy. Perhaps too easy of a metaphor—sometimes food is just food. Still, there is nothing like food and drink to remind us of life's pleasures, sating far more than hunger.\n",
      "line is: A good meal provides such sustenance not just out of need, but out of a whole host of things, whether reminding us of our childhoods, or grandparents, or the old country—or teaching us about a new one. Food transports us to another place like little else, even if it's just the couch after Thanksgiving turkey. I have put together this anthology to honor food's unique yet multifaceted pleasures. Nothing is as necessary yet as taken for granted these days as food—except maybe poetry. Both are bread and honey, water and wine, mother's milk and manna; and if ignored, or never used, both wither. Poetry keeps body and soul together and remarks upon what makes the human animal both one with and apart from the world.\n",
      "line is: Perhaps this is why I have never met a group more reliable to have a good meal with—and it should be said, a few drinks withthan poets. (Southerners are a close second.) Whether that meal means hunks of cheese sliced off with a knife alongside crusty bread and cheap wine; or enough homemade stew to feed a fort (or loft, or shared house); an extravagant feast on someone else's dime; or a nip of an uncle's moonshine: poets sure do throw down around the table. This, I think, is not just because a poet's next meal may always be in doubt, but because poets tend to love the details, the process of food, the languid hours of a good meal—meaning not just the vittles but the talk, often loud, that accompanies it.\n",
      "line is: This may also be because the best poems, like the best meals, are made from scratch. Both rely on the seasons, but also human history; both also consist of tradition, on knowledge passed down either from books or from generation to generation, hand to mouth. In poetry, there are few shortcuts, but there are secrets. Food and poetry each insist the we put our own twists and ingredients in the mix: we make each dish, like a good poem, our own. With any luck, the result is both surprising and satisfying, exactly what we wanted, perhaps without even knowing it.\n",
      "line is: However, we know too well the ways in which our society has abandoned good food, and too often poetry entirely—as if it grows without our water and light, and that our neglect won't reveal itself. \"Can one be inspired by rows of prepared canned meals?\" asks Alice B. Toklas, who knew her way around both poetry and a kitchen, publishing her famous cookbook after her life partner, Gertrude Stein, passed away. \"Never. One must get nearer to creation to be able to create, even in the kitchen.\"\n",
      "line is: Luckily, there seems to be a surge in returning to real food—some would say \"slow food,\" as opposed to fast—and if there's hope for what we insist we and our children eat, this may mean a world where poetry too can return to the table, where not just conversation, but culture, is made.\n",
      "line is: _A seat at_ / _the common table:_ this dream, shared by poet and pauper alike, is found in these pages.\n",
      "line is: In one crucial way, food differs from writing: food is temporary. It is exactly this fact, as many a writer will tell you, wherein the sublime pleasure of cooking really lies. After a long day of trying to be immortal, or at least get to the end of the blank page or screen—rather symbolically hitting SAVE—there is something satisfying in getting your hands dirty, in making something that has, necessarily, an obvious end point. With food, the better it is, the less it sticks around. (Except the way good food \"sticks to your ribs\" in the parlance of where I come from.) Temporariness is one of food's best qualities, making it something other than the chore that good writing can be. This is the opposite of good reading, in which the better it is the faster it flies. It is these fleeting yet everlasting pleasures that this anthology explores.\n",
      "line is: Moving through the seasons, from First Harvest to Sweet Summer, the cycle of life is shown here in its ups and downs—as only poetry can. Like the rallying cry of recent food advocates, my motto in picking these poems has been \"Eat Local\"—and like I say to my son, \"Eat what you like\"—I have been driven to include poets who write of the world around us and whose work makes my mouth water. What follows is a feast for the eyes and ear, one ranging from Pablo Neruda's famous odes to William Matthews's \"Onions\" to a host of evocations of blackberry picking—from Mary Oliver to Seamus Heaney; Galway Kinnell to Robert Hass to Yusef Komunyakaa. Indeed, there turn out to be a lot of fine blackberry poems, perhaps because they are both plentiful and primal. As a result, the anthology starts there, and like the seasons, circles back there, too. Along the way, we hear from James Beard Award-winning chefs like Linton Hopkins and, even in epigraphs, Julia Child and other homegrown cooks like Toklas; we sing along with drinking songs from Yeats and poems turned pop songs by Wyn Cooper, while enduring hangovers with James Wright. We visit questions of custom, memory, economy (in both the financial and poetic senses), and desire. We taste the bitterness of death, as well as the soothing food after.\n",
      "line is: I have written elsewhere—in my previous anthology, _The Art of Losing_ , and in my own food odes—of the healing power of food after loss. It is a tradition I know best from the African-American repast, but it can easily be seen in many others: from the Midwestern casserole or Southern collard greens brought to the house of mourning to an Irish wake, toasting those gone. Such meals and drink, whether sweet tea or hard cider, remind us we're alive, while also making us realize: what else can we do but provide some sustenance for those whose only meal otherwise may be sorrow?\n",
      "line is: Food also helps us to celebrate, to mark an occasion as well as a season—from birthday cake to egg nog; from \"praise wine\" to the bread of high holy days. The result, seen here, is the presence of food as both an everyday and extraordinary festivity—which is where, alongside poetry, it belongs.\n",

They were always exploring new animal habitats or collecting samples for their labs.\n",

And they would be visiting the famous sights that Benjamin had seen only in movies or in other people's photo albums.\n",

      "line is: The Baxters lived at the edge of the Florida Everglades, a wilderness full of plants and animals you couldn't see anywhere else in the country. Benjamin's parents seemed to know everything about the different species of the Everglades, and most of the time Benjamin loved to tag along when they went exploring.\n",

      "line is: IN MOSCOW I was always cold. I suppose that's what Russia is known for. Winter. But it is winter to a degree I could not have imagined before I moved there. Winter not of the pristine, romantic _Doctor Zhivago_ variety but a season so insistent and hateful that all hope freezes with your toes. The snow is cleared away too quickly to soften the city, so the streets are slushy with resentment. And I felt like the other young women trudging through that slush: sullen and tired, with a bluish tint to the skin below the eyes that suggests insomnia or malnutrition or a hangover. Or all of the above. Every day brought news of a drunk who froze to death. I saw one: slumped over on a bench on Tverskoy Boulevard with a bottle between his legs and icicles decorating his fingers. Distilled into something so pure and solid that I didn't recognize it as death until I got up close. The babushka next to me summoned the police.\n",
      "line is: I cracked under the weight of the cold. My only recourse was to eat. I inhaled entire packages of English tea biscuits in one sitting. They came stacked in a tube, and when I found myself halfway through one, I decided I might as well finish it. I polished off a whole tube every night after work and then pinched the extra flesh around my hips in the bathtub and thought, _At least I'm warm._\n",
      "line is: It was 1996. At the English-language newspaper where I worked, the other expats were always joking. Russia, with all its quirks, was funny. There was a sign at Sheremetyevo Airport, perched at the entrance to the short-term-parking lot, which had been translated into English as ACUTE CARE PARKING. It was a sign better suited to a hospital, where everything is dire. And at the smaller airports, the ones for regional flights, the Russian word for \"exit,\" _vykhod,_ was translated into English as GET OUT. A ticket to Sochi, for example, said you would be departing from Get Out #4. I laughed with them, but I knew that eventually these mistranslations would be corrected, that Russia would grow out of its awkward teenage capitalism and become smooth and nonchalant. You could see the growing pains in the pomaded hair of the nightclub bouncers, in the tinted windows of the Mercedes sedans on Tverskaya, in the garish sequins on the Versace mannequins posing in a shop around the corner from the Bolshoi Theater.\n",
      "line is: At the infamous Hungry Duck, I watched intoxicated Russian girls strip on top of the bar and then tumble into the greedy arms of American businessmen. American men still had cachet then; as an American woman, I hugged the sidelines. (\"Sarah,\" said the Russian men at my office, \"why you don't wear the skirts? Are you the feminist?\" They always laughed, and it was a deep, carnivorous sound that made me feel daintier than I am.) Everyone in Moscow was ravenous, and the potential for anarchy—I could feel its kaleidoscope effect—made a lot of foreigners giddy. Most of the reporters at my paper spoke some Russian. But among the copy editors, many of whom were fresh out of Russian-studies programs and itching to put their years in the language lab to good use, the hierarchy was built on who spoke Russian best. They were not gunning for careers in journalism; they just wanted to be in the new post-Soviet Moscow—the wild, wild East—and this job paid the bills. The Americans with Russian girlfriends—\"pillow dictionaries,\" they called them, aware that these lanky, mysterious women were far better-looking than anyone they'd touched back home—began to sound like natives. They were peacocks, preening with slang. In the office each morning, they'd pull off their boots and slide their feet into their _tapochki_ and head to the kitchen for instant coffee—Nescafé was our only option then—and they'd never mention their past lives in Wisconsin or Nevada or wherever they escaped from. _\"Oy,\"_ they said, and _\"Bozhe moy,\"_ which means \"my God\" but has anguish in Russian that just doesn't translate. A little bravado goes a long way toward hiding the loneliness. You can reinvent yourself with a different alphabet.\n",
      "line is: On Saturdays at the giant Izmailovo Market, tourists haggled for Oriental rugs and _matryoshka_ dolls painted to resemble Soviet leaders—Lenin fits into Stalin, who fits into Khrushchev, who fits into Brezhnev, who fits into Andropov, who fits into Gorbachev, who fits into Yeltsin. History reduced to kitsch. While shopping for Christmas gifts once, I stopped by a booth where a spindly drunk was selling old Soviet stamps. And there, pinned like a butterfly to a tattered red velvet display cushion, was Jenny. Her image barely warped by time. _\"Skolko?\"_ I said. The man asked too much. He had the deadened eyes of a person who hasn't been sober for years, and I didn't feel like bargaining, so I handed him the money. He could smell my desperation. He put the stamp in a Ziploc bag, and on the way back home on the Metro I studied her through the plastic. My best friend, commemorated like a cosmonaut. Her name had been transliterated into Cyrillic:   it said above the smiling photo of her freckled face. A five-kopeck stamp from the postal service of the USSR. I had just paid ten dollars for something that was originally worth next to nothing.\n",
      "line is: Conspiracy theorists will tell you that Jennifer Jones's death was not an accident. They will tell you that her plane crashed not because of mechanical failure, not because the pilot was suffering from dizzy spells, but because the CIA shot it down. She had become a Soviet pawn they say, too sympathetic to the party. Others say that the KGB was responsible, that after the press took pictures of her smiling at the Kremlin and quoted her saying how nice the Russians were, they needed to quit while they were ahead. I've read the official reports. I heard the pundits spew their Sunday-morning-talk-show ire. But I don't recognize the Jennifer Jones I knew in their versions of the story.\n",

It came from a real place of fear. The threat used to be so tangible. I was prepared to lose the people I loved best. My mother, with her fuzzy hair and lemon-colored corduroys; our dog, Pip; and Jenny. Always Jenny, whose last act must have been storing her tray table in its upright and locked position. Yuri Andropov wished her the best in her young life. Maybe this blessing was a curse.\n",
      "line is: I don't remember her, but I have watched the surviving Super 8 footage so many times that the scenes have seared themselves on my brain like memories. In the film, Isabel (Izzy, for short), four years old, dances on a beach. She is twirling, around and around and around again, until she falls in the sand. There is grace in her fall; she does not tumble in a heap but composes herself like a ballerina. She wears a bathing suit with the stars-and-stripes design that the U.S. swim team wore in the 1972 Summer Games in Munich. It is the same suit that Mark Spitz wore when he swam to gold seven times. On Izzy the Speedo bunches near her armpits but is taut across her stomach. Her body has already lost most of its toddler pudge. Her legs are long and lean and are beginning to show muscle definition. My parents were both athletes; Izzy's coordination and flexibility suggest that she, too, will win many races. But her belly still protrudes slightly like a baby's, and there are small pockets of fat on her upper thighs. Her hair is startlingly blond and tousled by the wind. Her eyes are green and transparent as sea glass. Behind her the ocean is calm. Her expression betrays—already!—a hint of skepticism. She is the sort of child who is universally declared beautiful. She looks directly at the camera, unafraid of meeting its gaze. My mother hovers at the right side of the frame in sunglasses and a wide-brimmed straw hat. She wears a pink paisley bikini, and she holds me, a juicy nine-month-old with a half-gnawed banana in my right hand, on her lap. The camera rests for a moment on my face, but I am blurry, and before the focus can be adjusted, the lens turns abruptly back to Izzy, who is kneeling in the sand, strangely reverent and, judging from her moving lips and rhythmically tilting head, singing something. The camera pans to my mother once more. She is laughing, head thrown back.\n",
      "line is: Three minutes of footage, shot in August of 1973, exactly one year before Nixon resigned. There are several notable things about this short film: (1) My mother looks relaxed and happy. Half of her face is obscured by the hat, yes, but the smile she wears is an irrepressible one. She is laughing at her older daughter, squeezing her younger one. She is all lightness and joy. (2) The camera lingers on her lovely legs for at least four seconds, which suggests that my father the auteur was, at this point, still very much in love with (or at least attracted to) my mother. (3) My sister is alive.\n",
      "line is: Just three months after this scene on the beach, Izzy died of meningitis. It was the sort of freak occurrence about which every parent has nightmares: a sudden fever that won't go down, a frantic call to the pediatrician—supposedly one of the city's best—and six hours later, despite said pediatrician's reassurances that \"it was nothing to worry about,\" a visit to the emergency room at Georgetown University Hospital, where my sister's meningitis was diagnosed too late to save her. It had already infected her spine and her brain.\n",
      "line is: This happened on November 7, 1973: my first birthday. Forever after that it was tainted. My parents could never bring themselves to celebrate it convincingly. During every subsequent birthday, they would excuse themselves at various points and disappear into their own private corners to grieve. At my fifth birthday party—the first one I remember—I could hear my mother's wails from the laundry room in the basement. The sound was so alarming that the clown who had been hired to make balloon animals kept popping her creations. She seemed skittish. \"Why is your mom crying?\" the kids from my kindergarten class wanted to know. \"I had a sister, and then she died,\" I said. I used to deliver this information matter-of-factly. It was no more weighty than the fact that our house was stucco or that my father was British. I was three when my parents told me I'd had a sister, and it was a relief to know that there was an explanation for the absence I'd felt for so long in my limbic memory. I'd reach for a baby doll—a doll I later learned had belonged to her—and picture it cradled in another set of arms. Sitting beneath our dining-room table once when I was four—I liked to crawl into private spaces to play—I was overcome with déjà vu. I was sure I had sat in the same spot with Izzy. It must have been just before she died. I must have been eleven months old. I could almost hear a breathy, high-pitched voice urging me to \"smile, little Sarah, smile!\"\n",

      "line is: IT IS A MYSTERY why those chronicling the history of photography have chosen to ignore Claude Marchand. This assistant of L.J.M. Daguerre (after whom the subject of this portrait was named) was the first American daguerreian. Marchand opened his New Orleans studio in the fall of 1838, and in November of the same year he staged the first public display of daguerreotypes. That these dates precede Daguerre's official announcement of August 19th, 1839, may be explained by the fact that Claude Marchand, a name so common in the Paris records of the day that an accurate biography is impossible, once admitted that he and Daguerre had been working on the invention together, and that after a spat with Daguerre he left the city \"with one of the earliest cameras and as many of the silvered brass plates as [his] pockets could hold.\" Out of fear of prosecution, or out of an odd respect for the European rights to the miracle that would lead Paul Delaroche to declare on the event of its unveiling, \"From today, painting is dead!\", Marchand made his way via sail to New Orleans. There he and the marvel he called soliotype were warmly received by the French community and the city at large.\n",
      "line is: Of the hubbub that arose when Daguerre presented his camera obscura and its shimmering trapped moments to the Académies des Sciences et des Beaux-Arts, the New Orleans Bee opined, \"It is no great surprise that the Europeans are aflutter about a miracle we have had for these many months. Once again America stands at the forefront of Science and Art.\"\n",
      "line is: Marchand flourished in the '40s as a photographer of varied stripe but he was best known as a portraitist. It was not purely novelty and the vanity of New Orleanians that led to his success. During the yellow fever epidemics that annually plagued the city it was common for doctors to recommend that the very ill be transported to Marchand's studio so that a last portrait could be made. In the middle four months of 1845, one of the worst summers of yellow fever the city ever saw, Marchand estimated photographing over 400 terminally ill and recently deceased fever victims.\n",

      "line is: My basic text has been Chrestien de Troyes, _Yvain: Le Chevalier au Lion_ (Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 1967), incorporating the critical text of Wendelin Foerster and with an introduction, notes, and glossary by T. B. W. Reid. I have sometimes disagreed with both Foerster and Reid as to matters of punctuation, and less often as to the precise meaning of a particular disputed passage. Two volumes I found absolutely indispensable are A.-J. Greimas, _Dictionnaire de l'ancien français, jusqu'au milieu du XIVe siècle_ (Paris: Larousse, 1980) and Frédéric Godefroy, _Lexique de l'ancien français,_ ed. J. Bonnard and Am. Salmon (Paris: Champion, 1976). I sometimes drew upon (and always enjoyed) William W. Kibler's beautifully written and sensitively conceived _An Introduction to Old French_ (New York: The Modern Language Association of America, 1984).\n",
      "line is: The most important decision for anyone translating a poem like _Yvain_ is formal: what does one do, in Modern English, with Chrétien's octosyllabic rhyming couplets? His metre is plainly an impossible one for the English version of a poem of 6,818 lines. (For comparative purposes, note that _Beowulf has_ 3,182 lines, and the _Odyssey_ roughly 12,000.) The closest formal equivalent, iambic tetrameter, would be more than risky. One necessarily tends, given the physical constraints of the measure, to place the caesura after every second foot. The great strength of iambic pentameter, never more fully demonstrated than in the end-stopped couplets of Alexander Pope, is that the caesura not only can never be placed in the exact middle of the line, there being indeed no exact middle available in a line of five rather than of four metrical feet, but that the greater length of the iambic pentameter line encourages placement of the caesura after the first, second, third, or fourth foot—and also permits use of more than one caesura in a line. Two marked metrical pauses would annihilate an iambic tetrameter line, which as I say naturally and almost inevitably tends to break at the midpoint. This makes iambic tetrameter excessively even, often monotonous, and especially monotonous at any length greater than that of a short lyric. Not surprisingly, in this century it is a metre that has been little used, even in shorter poems. The only modern poet to make extensive use of iambic tetrameter is AE (George William Russell). The best-informed and fairest critic of twentieth-century English and American poetry, David Perkins, rightly says that \"the poetry of Russell is inadequate to its theme, but in his case the trouble is not his experience, which was surely genuine, but his lack of technical and imaginative . . . skill\" ( _A History of Modern Poetry: From the 1890s to the High Modernist Mode_ [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1976], p. 256). Metre is neither the beginning nor the end of Russell's limitations, but it is a significant part of them.\n",
      "line is: Rhyme is an equally difficult matter. Not only is French considerably more rhyme-rich than is English, but it is also a syllable-timed rather than a stress-timed language. French prosody is therefore syllabic, while both the native form of English prosody—employed in the poetry composed during the Old English period, including _Beowulf_ —and the combination of stress and syllable-count prosody worked out in England in the centuries after the Norman Conquest, rely heavily on stress patterns. Milton could argue against, and dispense with, the use of rhyme for his _Paradise Lost._ No French poet either could or did make the same argument or follow the same practice.\n",
      "line is: And both metre and rhyme played poetic roles, for Chrétien, that they play no longer. Chrétien wrote his poetry; it is not oral verse in the sense that Homer's and much of Old English poetry have been shown to be. But like the other poets of his time, Chrétien regularly recited his poetry to the courtly audiences for whom it was written (as indeed _Aucassin et Nicolette,_ perhaps half a century later, was alternatively recited, in its prose portions, and sung, in its poetic portions). \"Since we lack access to native speakers of Old French,\" as Kibler drily observes, \"we cannot hope to acquire a perfect understanding of its pronunciation.\" But we do know that \"There was word stress (as in modern English) rather than only sentence stress (characteristic of modern French)\" (Kibler, pp. 8—9). The movement of Chrétien's verse, accordingly, is both designed for a distinctly colloquial mode and, in certain of its linguistic features, closer to English than the verse of, say, Racine or Baudelaire or Claudel. It is distinctly speech-like in syntax and lexicon. Rhyming octosyllabic couplets nicely carried those qualities, for Chrétien; they would not do the same for modern English or for modern English readers.\n",
      "line is: _Vers libre_ (free verse), though it has become the prevailing prosody of our time, is not truly suitable as an equivalent to Chrétien's couplets. The medieval concept of a quasi-epic romance requires an underlying formal prosodic regularity, a continuing sense for the audience (hearer or reader) of a reasonably uniform measure which can tie together an often episodic structure. To approximate Chrétien's verse movement and tone as closely as I could, I have therefore devised a flexible line of an invariable three stresses, but with varying numbers of unstressed syllables. In practice, this measure varies from an extreme of four total syllables to the opposite extreme of thirteen total syllables. A quick but probably largely accurate count reveals only five instances of these extremes, lines 4346, 5180, and 6341 having four total syllables, and lines 5855 and 5987 having thirteen total syllables. Only line 4632 has twelve total syllables. The vast majority of the lines in this translation are clustered within a range of six to nine syllables. The measure seems to me—and more importantly, seems to the scholars whose advice and criticism I have sought, notably Ronnie Apter, John Miles Foley, and Alexandra H. Olsen—to adapt well to the pace and to the moods of Chrétien's measure.\n",
      "line is: The function of rhyme in a poem intended primarily for the ear, rather than for the eye, does not seem reproducible in modern English. Nor does rhyme seem either necessary, given the changed literary conditions of our era, or useful, given (as Milton declares in the prefatory note to _Paradise Lost)_ that \"Rime {is} no necessary Adjunct or true Ornament of Poem or good Verse, in longer works especially.\" As he adds, poets who have used rhyme have been obliged \"much to thir own vexation, hindrance, and constraint to express many things otherwise, and for the most part worse than else they would have exprest them.\" Three hundred and more years after Milton wrote those indignant sentences, we no longer need to claim \"an ancient liberty recover'd to Heroic Poem from the troublesom and modern bondage of Riming.\"\n",
      "line is: This brief preface is not intended as either a historical or a critical statement. I should note, however, that the translation was undertaken because Chrétien is a great and influential poet who has been virtually nonexistent in English. Further, _Yvain_ can be considered his masterpiece. It is fully as impressive as, though of course different from, such well-known twelfth-century works as _Le Chanson de Roland_ and _La Poema de Mió Cid._ Those poems have been fortunate enough to find not only one but several superbly capable translators. Chrétien in general, and _Yvain_ in particular, have not been so fortunate. It has been my hope to remedy a situation patently out of balance, and I will be content if this translation allows the modern English reader some reasonably clear view of Chrétien's swift, clear style, his wonderfully inventive storytelling, his perceptive characterizations and sure-handed dialogue, his racy wit and sly irony, and the vividness with which he evokes, for us as for his twelfth-century audiences, the emotions and the values of a flourishing, vibrant world. Chrétien is a delight to read—and to translate.\n",
      "line is: In addition to the scholars already mentioned, I am deeply grateful to Professor Joseph J. Duggan, of the University of California at Berkeley, for agreeing to read through the entire translation with one of the most practiced and knowledgeable eyes in the literary world, for supplying the afterword, and for supplying the bibliography.\n",
      "line is: My largest debt, which is expressed in very brief form in the dedication, is to Eli Sagan, a distinguished psycho-sociologist who had the wit to put together Chrétien and myself and whose support in making the translation was literally indispensable.\n",
      "line is: Lord Yvain, though they'd cheerfully have killed him.\n",

Please go on imagining me, otherwise I won't be able to lunge at you and crush your windpipe when I can't bear it anymore.\n",
      "line is: I think I should stop thinking about it, if I've really made it up, if it isn't actually real. Like this room, which seems to be a room, although I know that in reality I'm in the womb of a body I don't recognize. But as usual, the worst-case scenario is that all apparent contrast is just sameness, reflected back as though in a mirror: What if the animal is also thinking me? Then we're both finished, no matter which one of us makes the first move. This is why I lie in a room that is not a room, while the animal, nervous with hunger, licks my hand.\n",
      "line is: Say that you're kissing a strange girl. Yes, things like that do happen. Say that you'd gone to a bar, you'd drunk even more than usual, say that you hadn't gone along with your colleagues this time, remembering your wife sneering as you picked up your briefcase: \"Do all these meetings have to end up in a strip joint? Couldn't you go, I don't know, pick up used needles down by the train station instead?\" So you'd thought of her and told your colleagues you wouldn't be coming with them today, and then you'd ended up in this bar. And when this girl joined you at your table because all the other seats were taken, it didn't feel wrong. And when you paid for the drinks and she thanked you and lightly touched your arm, it didn't feel wrong. And when you leaned close to her and spoke into her ear because it was getting noisier and noisier and her skin was nearer and nearer, it didn't feel wrong. You thought: If you look down into an abyss, there's a force that pulls you in, you can't help it, there's nothing wrong with that. But when you caressed her knee, sort of inadvertently, and then a bit more and a bit higher, you felt that there might be something there, something possibly slightly wrong. That things might not be what they seem.\n",
      "line is: Sure, you'd read that funny dating-advice book. How can you tell the gender of your date in advance? In men, the ring finger is longer than the index finger, the knuckles are hairy, the Adam's apple is prominent, the shoulders are broader than the hips. That sort of thing. But the bar is dark. Too dark. And you don't know if perhaps something might be terribly wrong.\n",
      "line is: These things happen, things that are terribly wrong. Your wife doesn't like you going to strip clubs, you think. But there, in a strip club, things are clear. What you see is what you get. Everything's in plain sight. You're told the prices at the bar. But what about now? What now? You reach for your cell phone. No, your colleagues won't give you advice, they'll laugh at you, they'll say: \"Go for it, go the whole nine yards. If you can't tell the difference it doesn't matter anyway.\" But it does matter. There is definitely a difference. Who can you call? What would your wife say if you called and said, \"I'm not at a strip club, and I'm not picking up used needles either, I'm kissing someone and I'm not sure—\"\n",
      "line is: No, this isn't acceptable. That's why the warm lips moving up your neck fill you with dread: It's nearly closing time, and maybe even then they won't turn up the lights, maybe you'll both just rise to leave and probably that's when that little question will be posed: \"Coming with me?\" What do you say then? There are, as always, two options. But which one's the right one? You wish you were in a strip club with your friends, you'd know what to say, you'd say, \"Check, please!\" and leave, everything would be all right. When they asked you if you were coming along, you should have said yes. Soon now the same question might get asked. And what are you going to say?\n",
      "line is: It's odd to wake up in a strange apartment. You look at the woman lying next to you. How did you get here? You can't strike up a conversation with a woman reading Coelho on the train, really. And yet, it happens. Now you're here. She's asleep. You listen: She's still breathing. It would be awful if she wasn't. Who would you call? How would you explain? As it is, everything can be repaired. On the floor, the remnants of last night, leftover food and drink. You feel like cleaning up, you don't want to be useless, last night seems to have been nice, you didn't talk much, it all went ahead without words. But: It's not easy to clean up when you're on strange turf. How to know the proper way to separate the garbage? You used to assess strange apartments by their books and their records. Wherever you went: A quick glance along the bookshelves. And you knew. But you can no longer rely on that. Everyone's books and music are increasingly alike. Waste separation is the thing now. Where do you put the paper, the glass, the organic waste? You look all around, you peer under the sink, but there are no options, just a single container. No other choices. Quietly, you put on your shoes.\n",
      "line is: The sea on the one side, cliffs on the other. Highway, high beams. The music helps me keep my eyes open. Short songs about love that hurts. It's only midnight. Seduce me, honey, let's kill some time. She'll never know we've been together. It's only midnight, let's go wild. Do you think of me when you're with her? But before you take my clothes off, you should know that my body does come with a soul, and as I give you one, you get the other as well.\n",
      "line is: All love affairs come to an unhappy end, is what the songs say. It's all so far away, also so close. In the distance, the flickering lights of a gas station. I bide my time. Looking. My breath fogs up the window. Therefore I am. I've been thinking about it for quite a while, now I know. He'll stop for gas. I'll take my purse and say I need to go to the ladies' room, I'll get in another car, I bet there's one open and ready, and I'll start on another journey. I'm sure there are other journeys. I'm sure he'll understand. So much music, explaining everything. All love affairs come to an unhappy end, is what the songs say.\n",
      "line is: \"It's no good for a woman to travel alone,\" he said just before she got out. She didn't look back. \"I know,\" she said, closing the door. \"It's dangerous,\" he added, speaking to the closed door, then shrugged and started the car. Whoever picks her up here is bound to be dangerous, he thought. Dangerous because only dangerous people pick up hitchhikers in dangerous places like this.\n",
      "line is: I know, she thought again, I know that all right. It's no good for a woman to travel alone. It's dangerous. Luckily I still have that knife in my purse. I didn't want to leave it behind. I wiped it thoroughly, but you never know. They still could've found something when they found him. Dangerous, sure it is, all sorts of things can happen when you're hitchhiking. You never know who'll pick you up. And you never know what you'll be like when you get out again.\n",

      "line is: We said last time that 2001 was an excellent year for the science fiction short story. The year 2002 was, if anything, even better. Many stories were challenging, literate, thought-provoking, and entertaining for the mind in the ways that make SF a unique genre.\n",
      "line is: The good news in the book publishing area is that nothing particularly bad happened in 2002. SF publishing as we have known it is nine mass market publishing lines (Ace, Bantam, Baen, DAW, Del Rey, Eos, Roc, Tor, Warner—ten if you count Pocket Book's Star Trek line), and those lines continue, though you will find Ace, Roc, and DAW all part of the Penguin conglomerate, and Bantam and Del Rey both part of Random House (now so closely allied that a Del Rey hardcover became a Bantam SF paperback lead this year). Mass market distributors are still pressing all publishers to reduce the number of titles and just publish \"big books,\" but SF and fantasy seem to be resisting further diminution.\n",
      "line is: The last SF and fantasy magazines that are widely distributed are Analog, Asimov's, F&SF, and Realms of Fantasy. All of them published a lot of good fiction this year, we are pleased to report. The U.S. is the only English-language country that still has any professional, large-circulation magazines, though Canada, Australia, and the UK have several excellent magazines. The semi-prozines—for example, Interzone, Tales of the Unanticipated, Spectrum SF, Black Gate—mirror the \"little magazines\" of the mainstream in function, holding to professional editorial standards and publishing the next generation of writers, along with some of the present masters.\n",
      "line is: The small presses were a very healthy presence. We have a strong short-fiction field today in part because the small presses publishing semi-professional magazines, single-author collections, and anthologies are printing and circulating a majority of the high-quality fiction published in SF and fantasy and horror. One significant trend noticeable in the small press anthologies this year was toward genre-bending slipstream stories. The SF Book Club, now part of the mega-corporation (Bookspan) that resulted from the combination of all of the Literary Guild and Book of the Month Club divisions, continues to be an innovative and lively publisher, as well as an influential reprinter. Good anthologies and collections are harder than ever to select on the bookstore shelves from among the mediocre ones, but you will find some of the best books each year selected for SFBC editions, often the only hardcover editions of those anthologies.\n",
      "line is: The best original anthologies of the year in our opinion were Leviathan 3, edited by Jeff VanderMeer and Forrest Aguirre; Polyphony, edited by Jay Lake; Conjunctions 39, edited by Peter Straub—these books mixing SF and fantasy with slipstream fiction; Mars Probes, edited by Peter Crowther (DAW); Embrace the Mutation, edited by Bill Sheehan; Agog, edited by Cat Sparks; and The DAW 30th Anniversary SF Anthology, edited by Betsy Wollheim and Sheila Gilbert (which contained in general long episodes from popular novel series rather than independent stories; there was also a companion volume for fantasy). Of these, the particular excellences of Polyphony, Conjunctions 39, Leviathan, and Embrace the Mutation were mostly in the realm of fantasy, and the especial pleasures of Mars Probes were in SF. So you will find a couple of stories here from Mars Probes, but should look to our companion Year's Best Fantasy 3 for stories from the other books. The rest of the paperback original anthologies of the year should best be considered as equivalent to single issues of magazines, and on that basis, 2002 was on the whole not a distinguished year for original anthologies in paperback.\n",
      "line is: Several online short fiction markets (Infinite Matrix, SciFiction, and Strange Horizons) helped to cushion the loss in recent years of print media markets for short fiction. We found some excellent science fiction, particularly from editor Ellen Datlow's SciFiction site, now the highest-paying market in the genre for short fiction, although both the others were of quite high quality in general. We offer stories from them in this book for perhaps the first time in print.\n",
      "line is: In 2002 it was good to be reading the magazines, as well, both professional and semi-pro. It was a very strong year for novellas, and there were more than a hundred shorter stories in consideration. So we repeat, for readers new to this series, the usual disclaimer: This selection of science fiction stories represents the best that was published during the year 2002. It would take two or three more volumes of this size to include nearly all of the best short stories—though even then, not all of the best novellas. And we believe that representing the best from year to year, while it is not physically possible to encompass it all in even one very large book, also implies presenting some substantial variety of excellences, and we left some worthy stories out in order to include others in this limited space.\n",
      "line is: Our general principle for selection: This book is full of science fiction—every story in the book is clearly that and not something else. We have a high regard for horror, fantasy, speculative fiction, and slipstream, and postmodern literature. We (Kathryn Cramer and David G. Hartwell) edit the Year's Best Fantasy in paperback from Eos as a companion volume to this one—look for it if you enjoy short fantasy fiction, too. But here, we chose science fiction.\n",
      "line is: We try to represent the varieties of tones and voices and attitudes that keep the genre vigorous and responsive to the changing realities out of which it emerges, in science and daily life. This is a book about what's going on now in SF. The stories that follow show, and the story notes point o\n",
      "line is: Bruce Sterling <www.well.com/conf/mirrorshades> lives in Austin, Texas. The novel Schismatrix (1985) and the related stories that made him famous were re-released in 1996 as Schismatrix Plus. He collaborated with William Gibson on The Difference Engine (1990), became a media figure who appeared on the cover of Wired, became a journalist who wrote the exposé The Hacker Crackdown (1992), and returned his attention to science fiction in 1995, with a new explosion of stories and novels, including Heavy Weather (1994), Holy Fire (1996), and Distraction (1998). His most recent novel, Zeitgeist (2000), is fantasy. His interest in the political and cultural implications of future change has informed his work, and in his recent nonfiction book, Tomorrow Now: Envisioning the Next Fifty Years (2002), he re-imagines the future after the turn of the 21st century.\n",
      "line is: \"In Paradise\" was published in F&SF, a magazine that published a large number of especially good stories this year. It is a madly jolly, near-future love story, in which the machete of satire is wielded against the advent and spread of intrusion into the private lives of citizens in the name of homeland security. Certain moral and ethical problems are oversimplified so that love conquers all. It is first in this book because we found it so representative of the year 2002 and so much fun.\n",

      "line is: Angela Wakefield had arrived early, partly because she was a compulsively prompt person—law school had taught her the wisdom of that—but equally because she wanted to savor these moments before their little party began. So she sat, her legs neatly crossed at the ankle, her purse on the third chair, and stared out the window at the water. Marblehead, Massachusetts, was so beautiful that it was not a place she'd ever imagined making her home—her, a dago Jew mongrel from Queens, New York. Even now, though it was well into autumn, sailboats were tacking their way across the harbor, fishing boats were pulling into dock as the sunset turned to twilight. Distant lights had begun to twinkle in homes along the water.\n",
      "line is: Reid had picked the restaurant and, just like Reid, the club was perfectly groomed. The white cloths on the table glowed in the waning light; the glass and silverware gleamed. The starched napkins had been folded into complicated shapes, kind of like the newspaper soldier hats she used to make to play army, though these napkins were much prettier.\n",
      "line is: Angie looked around self-consciously. She was never so neat, so well-pressed as the napkins. Her hair was wild, black and curly, long and not really styled; her clothes were always wrinkled or losing a button. She was told often by Reid that it was part of her charm. Why else would Reid have married her?\n",
      "line is: Angie looked around the club dining room. She knew not to expect much from the food in places like this: go to a Brookline deli or Boston's North End for good food. Here the martinis would be dry, the service impeccable. Angie never felt very comfortable alone in the club. She shifted in her chair. In just a little while—since he was usually late—Reid Wakefield III, her husband of one year today, would be sitting opposite her. Reid was comfortable anywhere. He belonged not only to this club but the birthright club welcomed by all.\n",
      "line is: When the waiter approached Angela inwardly groaned. He asked for her drink order, but she didn't want to start without Reid, so she apologized and said she'd wait, if it was okay. \"He should be here any minute,\" she added, checking her watch. Reid was already twenty minutes late, but he was chronic that way, always overscheduling, always so involved with whatever he was doing that he forgot about whatever he was committed to do next. Well, not forget about, exactly. He just juggled a little and—because of his charm—everyone forgave him.\n",
      "line is: Angie used the time now to pull out her makeup kit and surreptitiously check her face. It was a pretty face—roundish, with round dark eyes, and a generous mouth. Okay, let's face it—a big mouth in both senses of the word. Now her mouth needed more lipstick—why did it wear off her lips but not off her teeth? She ought to comb her hair, though she knew she shouldn't do that at the table.\n",
      "line is: Angie sighed. She was what she was, and Reid had picked her, not one of these real blond, anemic poster girls for Miss Porter's School. They all had names like Elizabeth and Emily and Sloane, but they—in their understated, unwrinkled clothes and untreated hair—hadn't attracted the prince that she had. _Take that, you Waspettes!_\n",
      "line is: Reid represented sunshine, vitality, and the kind of life that did not have to acknowledge defeat. Cushioned by money and contacts, his family boated and played tennis and celebrated birthdays and weddings and even funerals in a dignified way that boasted of order and control.\n",
      "line is: Not that Angela was proud of her heritage. Anyway, all of them were new immigrants compared to Reid's family. The Wakefields had come over after the _Mayflower_ , but only just. Reid's mother, on the other hand, was a Daughter of the American Revolution—and looked it. She didn't color her hair or worry about fashion. She was a Barbara Bush type, but prouder. She'd never said that she was disappointed in Reid's mate, but when Angie thought about it, she didn't know what they had to be so proud of—they'd stolen their land from the Native Americans. Angela figured they got some credit for stealing it early. And they still owned plenty of it in and around Marblehead.\n",
      "line is: Angie put her lipstick away and pulled out the wrapped gift she had for her husband. It was their paper anniversary and she had racked her brain to come up with the right present. Here it was: an autographed first edition of Clarence Darrow's autobiography. Reid—a newly minted lawyer working for Andover Putnam, the most old-line of Boston's old-line law firms—worshipped Darrow. He'd _plotz_. Angie patted the package and grinned.\n",
      "line is: She didn't allow herself to get too excited by the prospect of his gift to her, though. Men weren't that good with gifts or romance. Especially WASP men from old money. She'd learned that already: for their first married Christmas, Reid had given her a pair of ski gloves—even though she didn't ski. When she'd suggested they spend their first romantic weekend away, he'd opted for Springfield, to visit the Basketball Hall of Fame. As if. Worst, for her birthday he'd given her a coffee grinder. She shook her head now, remembering the scene when she'd opened the elaborately wrapped box. \"But don't you _like_ fresh ground?\" Reid had asked, shocked when in answer she'd thrown the thing at him. They'd had a huge fight. Later she'd called her mother. \"A coffee grinder?\" she'd asked. \"Is it a Braun? Hey, he's trainable. Your father once gave me an ironing board.\"\n",

The summer evenings are endless and still, the sky bright well past ten, and the vast lake pale and calm like the very faintest shade of blue on a color wheel.

No. Nothing but this, an impossible life of lightness and dreams. Sam and the baby and me, on our island of three.\n",
      "line is: Like most mornings after I put the baby down for his nap, I went into the kitchen to bake. Today, a pie from the blueberries we'd picked in the forest this past weekend. I made the dough myself and rolled it out, pricked it with a fork, baked it blind to crisp it. The sun was already streaming in through the big open windows, rays of light casting themselves across the floors of our bright little house. The ripened berries I cooked low and slow, excising out the juices over the heat with maple syrup and a stick of cinnamon, careful not to let it all burn and spoil. Sam in his studio smelled the butter and the sugar and the sweetness of the fruit; he came out to the kitchen to see what I'd made. He looked at me and grinned, just as pleased as punch.\n",

Patient and instinctive. Fierce with love for their young, as nature demands.\n",
      "line is: Sam and I walked the baby over to watch them in the field. Horse, Sam said, and he pointed and neighed, and the baby was in hysterics. I reached out a hand to a chestnut-brown mare who had approached the fence, felt the quiver of life and taut muscle under my fingers. She was beautiful. Strong and certain. Her black eyes were fierce.\n",

The pantomimes, surgeons' behaviour, housemen's antics and patients are, I hope, faithfully portrayed. The dialogue is, of course, fictitious. I have tried to capture the way people talked rather than give verbatim records.\n",

      "line is: To the general reader: I may have given away a few trade secrets of what went on behind the starched uniforms, but only to reveal the essential humour and humanity of a great Yorkshire hospital. You have to remember that the majority of doctors and nurses, who essentially ran the hospital, were under thirty. If their youthful shenanigans shock you, I assure you that their patients always, yes always, came first.\n",
      "line is: A NURSE AT LAST! I see myself comforting those in pain; soothing fevered brows; saying, 'There, this will make you feel better'; carefully changing dressings and efficiently plumping pillows so that a patient lies back with a sigh of gratitude.\n",

As well as waist pockets it has breast pockets, plus slots for holding pens and scissors. A separate rigid, round white collar is held on the dress with a safety pin and fastens with a stud at the front. The starched apron has a bib held up by tiepins and a waistband that also fastens with studs. Black stockings and shoes complete the outfit. Stocking seams have to be straight. I twist to check before attaching them to my suspender belt.\n",

      "line is: Shirley loved things like that. She liked jokes and laughing and making people laugh. She had a pearl ring that could squirt out a stream of water when someone leaned over to admire it, and a set of windup chattering teeth, and a pair of green sunglasses a foot wide. Shirley had won the glasses at a carnival. When she wore them, she looked like a fly.\n",

      "line is: It was the first day of school. The first day of fourth grade.\n",
      "line is: \"Yuck,\" said Shirley. Shirley did _not_ love school. She hated it. It was her number one hate. Shirley had something called dyslexia. It was a learning disability. Her eyes saw letters and numbers but the letters and numbers got twisted around on the way to her brain. They were turned upside down and downside up, and made into a big jumble. Reading and writing and math were the hardest for Shirley. If Shirley didn't concentrate, concentrate, concentrate, reading English was as difficult as reading Chinese.\n",
      "line is: Shirley's parents had taken her to a million doctors and clinics before they found out exactly what was wrong. Shirley had thought that was stupid. What was wrong was that she could barely read or write, and math was a mystery to her. Who needed a doctor to tell them that? Any fool could see it.\n",

      "line is: The match struck and sputtered. Victor tried again. He put match head to phosphate strip with the gentle pressure of one long finger and the thing sparked and caught and for the briefest of moments he held a yellow flame. Victor—curled into himself like a question mark, a joint hanging from his mouth; Victor with his hair natural in two thick braids, a red bandanna folded and knotted to hold them back; Victor—with his dark eyes and his thin shoulders and his _cafecito con leche_ skin, wearing a pair of classic Air Jordans, the leather so white it glowed—imagine him how you will because he hardly knew how to see himself. He was nineteen years old and should have felt as sweet as a bluebird in the dew, but in the awful damp of the early morning, after another night of sleeping on cold concrete—or not sleeping—he moved like an old man, grumbling like the world was out to get him, had in fact perhaps already gotten him, struck him down without mercy or care or intent as if it hadn't even seen him standing there, he had just been in the way.\n",
      "line is: He knelt and made a cup of his two brown hands. Look at him bowing his head to this fragile light, joint pinched between his lips, wearing a puffy down jacket, olive green and so ragged he might have found it abandoned on the beach. Listen to the quiet rhythm of his breath. This is his morning ritual, the closest this boy comes to prayer. Skinny Victor, who believed in his heart of hearts that most everything was bullshit, for three years he had tramped the world and still he had no idea just how it worked, how people managed daily life on this blue-green planet of slums and smog, the easy knife, the lazy blade.\n",
      "line is: The traffic on the freeway thundered over his head, the sound of the big trucks hitting the joints of the highway a muted clacking like a pair of spoons. Beyond the cave of the underpass, beyond the water and the warehouses, out in the city where the streets climbed from the docks to the downtown core, the sound of the chanting crowd was a distant buzzing—fifty thousand desperate flies knocking against fifty thousand closed windows. Victor had heard talk of it for weeks. At the shelter. Bumming smokes from the tourists on the pier. At the coffee shop nursing a tea and swiping scraps from the empty plates. And now, here they were, thousands in the streets and the way their voices rose and fell, sliding down the hill, ringing off the renovated lofts, the brick apartments, the cars parked nose to tail along the oil-black street—it was like an alarm bell sounding in his chest. It was the million-voiced ocean roar of Calcutta or Caracas booming from their angry mouths, echoing in the canyons of smoked glass and steel.\n",
      "line is: He had been camped in a cheap tent beneath the underpass for three months now and he had put his mind to the matter, rolled it around in that big old brain, and he knew this much—he needed to get the fuck out.\n",
      "line is: The calculus of kind bud, the physics of dispersal, the geometry of escape.\n",
      "line is: He had more sticky, stinky, purple-haired marijuana on his person than ever before in his short life, and the glory of it, the mind-fucking enormity of the possibilities, had him whirling.\n",
      "line is: Because weed equaled cash and cash equaled a ticket on the airline of his choice to the destination of his choice. He was going to ignore how he scored the weed because escape velocity was the dope necessary to break free from the gravity of home's heavy hold. Lord, let us fly. Yeah, get the feet moving at a pleasant cruising speed of five hundred miles per hour to some dark and lovely corner of the globe. Let pilot and copilot read the dials and mark the birds; Victor only wanted to recline his seat and watch the border recede below him like a line of marching ants following a trail of sugar to its source.\n",
      "line is: He lowered his head to the flame, mindful of his braids. But in the windiest spot he could have chosen, his hands proved an insufficient home. His little cardboard match, his little paper flame, she bent horizontal and made her exit, disappeared before she had done what work he required.\n",
      "line is: He gave up. Dropped joint and matchbook in the breast pocket of his down jacket and retired to his tent, where he ducked inside and gathered his sleeping bag in his arms and stuffed it into its sack. He rolled his mat and tied it with a length of cord. He sat on the roll of foam and slid off his shoes and removed an old toothbrush from the pocket of his jacket and began polishing the white leather, the brush kept strictly for this purpose. The shoes he hadn't seen in years. A gift from his father, long ago. So long ago it seemed like another life. He had kept them boxed for years—preserved in the clean antiseptic air of an anger so large and old and familiar he had no name for it. His father.\n",
      "line is: In the morning when he woke and at night before turning in and during the odd windblown moments of the day when the boredom or regret or homesickness were so heavy he felt them like a knot in the pit of his stomach—he swept and tidied. He put things in their place. Joint in his pocket, braids behind his ears. Memory and longing a black gunpowder he tamped down the wide-bore barrel of his neck. Even here, living beneath an underpass with the rumbling traffic overhead and bits of metal, he didn't know what, slivers of brake pad, oil-flecked grit, drifting down and settling in his hair, grinding between his teeth and covering his tent in a fine film of filth—even here, yes, he cleaned and swept.\n",

      "line is: It has been eight years since this memoir was first published, and as I write now, the nation is in a state of great tension. On September 11, 2001, teams of hijackers flew two passenger planes, loaded with jet fuel, into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in downtown Manhattan, and the ensuing catastrophe killed close to three thousand people who were burned or crushed to death as the buildings burst into flames and collapsed.\n",
      "line is: Like so many others who saw those events on television, I was horrified. And when President George W. Bush immediately announced to the nation that we were now at war, I was horrified again because solving problems with bombs has never worked. It seemed clear to me that this was exactly the wrong response to the act of terrorism that had just occurred. And when, soon after, the United States began bombing Afghanistan, I considered that, if terrorism can be defined as the willingness to kill innocent people for some presumed good cause, this was another form of terrorism—one I had seen up close many years ago after meeting the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who also suffered needlessly for an alleged \"good cause.\"\n",
      "line is: In this book I tell of my experience as a bombardier in the Second World War. I describe how I came to the conclusion, after dropping bombs on European cities, and celebrating the victory over fascism, that war, even a \"good war,\" while it may bring immediate relief, cannot solve fundamental problems. Indeed, the glow of that \"good war\" has been used to cast a favorable light over every bad war for the next fifty years, wars in which our government lied to us, and millions of innocent people died.\n",
      "line is: Just five years after the end of the Second World War, we were at war with Korea, bombing villages, using napalm, destroying much of the country. That war was barely over when the United States intervened in Vietnam, with a half million troops and the most deadly bombing campaign in world history. I write here about my involvement in the movement against that war. Since then, our government has found reasons to bomb Panama, and Iraq, and Yugoslavia. We have become addicted to war.\n",
      "line is: Today the movie screens are filled with images of military heroism, and my generation is hailed as \"the greatest generation.\" In such films as Band of Brothers, Windtalkers, Saving Private Ryan, Memphis Belle, and others, World War II is being brought back to make us feel good about war.\n",
      "line is: My refusal to justify war has a simple logic. War in our time inevitably means the indiscriminate killing of large numbers of innocent people (no matter what claims are made by confident government officials about \"smart bombs\" and \"we only aim at military targets\"). Thus, the means of waging war are evil and certain. The ends of war, however proclaimed as noble (putting aside the historical evidence that aims are not really \"democracy\" and \"liberty,\" but political ambition, corporate profit, a lust for oil), are always uncertain.\n",
      "line is: Two months after the United States began to bomb Afghanistan, I read a dispatch by a reporter for the Boston Globe, writing from a hospital in Jalalabad. \"In one bed lay Noor Mohammad, 10, who was a bundle of bandages. He lost his eyes and hands to the bomb that hit his house after Sunday dinner.... The hospital's morgue received 17 bodies last weekend, and officials here estimate at least 89 civilians were killed in several villages.\"\n",
      "line is: The moral question was clear. One boy now without hands and eyes. There was no possible connection between him and the events of September 11 in New York. There was no possibility that the crippling of his face and body, or that any of the bombs dropped for months on Afghanistan, would reduce or eliminate terrorism. Indeed, more likely, the acts of violence on both sides would reinforce one another, and would create an endless cycle of death and suffering.\n",
      "line is: That scene in the hospital would need to be multiplied by a thousand times (because at least a thousand, and perhaps five thousand civilians died under our bombs, with many others maimed, wounded) to make a proper moral reckoning of whether the war on Afghanistan can be justified by anyone claiming to care about human rights.\n",

Herein there will be no warnings or recognition of first offenses regarding violation of this so-called dumbass agreement, and the resulting punishment will most likely happen when you least expect it, coming at the author's earliest convenience, depending on his amateur squash league schedule and other proclivities.

      "line is: I'd love to say I remember it well, but the fact of the matter is my old friend Jack Daniels and I had engaged in a battle of wills that night. Jack won; I placed. So what I can muster from my shitty college dorm room called a memory bank is fuzzy, at least for the first half of the proceedings. Through nobody's fault but my own, shit happened all down my leg. That is as close to foreshadowing as I am going to go at this point because what I do recall is precariously close to the sort of thing you hear about when someone sits you down for a cautionary tale about drugs and booze and bullshit. So pretend for a moment that I am the parent and you are the child. I think it goes without saying that you're snickering, and the paltry attempts to stave off that snickering is not appreciated, but I get it. It is indeed a strain to imagine yours truly as the voice of reason. After all, I'm the guy who stuck his dick in an orange at a meet-and-greet for $26.10 . . . in change. Please just bear with me if you can bear the tension. I promise the following story will not only set the stage for this book in rare form but will also hopefully make you chuckle, chortle, and snort as well. God forbid, you might even learn something. I highly doubt that last prediction.\n",
      "line is: If you've read any of my other tomes of torment, you will naturally understand that twelve years ago was my notorious epic run during the making of Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses. Honestly, I could milk that period of my life for as long as I punch pain into inputs, but this book is much more about the present and the future. So I am only going to dip into this particular ink well for a brief moment because it has some insight into the topic at hand. It involves alcohol, various nefarious drugs, a party, a redhead, and a man in an ill-fitting bandana wearing leather pants. I don't even remember their names—probably because I never bothered to learn them. So giving them names that are most likely not the ones they were blessed with isn't out of respect; it's because I simply didn't give a shit about them in the first place. In fact, if they do read this and get offended I couldn't care less. They're the ones with enough egg on their faces to make omelets for an entire Los Angeles basketball team, so fuck them.\n",

      "line is: I started this night at the hole of holes, the heaven of hells: the Rainbow Bar and Grill. I know—this place appears in so much of my writing that I'd have to cast it as an actual person in any movie made about my life. However, it has always been a giant, beautiful nugget in the gold mine of my absurdities. Thank fuck this story is not a spotlight on my dumb shit; I am merely the one who had to witness the buggery. But all tales start somewhere. The starting pistol sounded off at the outside bar, where respectable people can still have a cigarette nuzzled up against finished mahogany while drowning themselves in libations. There's another piece of fine \"intelligence\": \"Hey, I'm going to go inside this place and blow my brains out on alcohol, thereby killing my brain cells and liver while also doing damage to other vital organs. I might even do some blow in the bathroom. But those other fuckers better go outside to SMOKE!\" Fuckin' savages . . .\n",
      "line is: I was hanging out with a friend who had been invited to a party in Silver Lake, a section of LA not too terribly far from the Rainbow. Well, I say not too terribly far: the truth is, I didn't know how far it was—I wasn't driving. All I remember was climbing into my friend's sedan afterward and hanging out the window to let the cool air put the kibosh on my spins. I believe there was even a spirited debate about whether we could cruise through the Del Taco drive-thru for inexpensive meat envelopes. Now that I think about it, I do have a visual of taking a piss behind a dumpster in the parking lot while chatting with a nice gentleman who was none too pleased about the expulsion, maybe because I was singing \"And We Danced\" by the Hooters at concert volume. People in line at the outside menu couldn't be heard on the speaker. I guess I was calling way too much attention to his rummaging around in those giant canisters for fuck-knows-what. Once I was back in the car and loaded for bear with crappy fast food, we got back on track. Then before I knew it, we were at the party.\n",
      "line is: In retrospect I can only call it a party in passing. If I can be completely frank, I've had crazier bowel movements. First of all, there were too many dumbasses and not enough chemicals. In other words, there wasn't enough \"happy\" to go around. Second, the men and women entrenched in this place would make the world's most brain-dead frat brothers look like Mensa members in comparison. It's the same problem I've come across at other parties I've gone to in Hollywood: too much posing and strutting and not enough actual partying. You have to remember the kind of people I was used to throwing down with. I was accustomed to maniacs jumping off of roofs and setting walls on fire once they were done sniffing the gasoline fumes. This was basically a bunch of shit heels running around a two-bedroom ranch-style box on a side street in suburban California, trying like hell to look good and catch a buzz before the beer and pills ran out. It didn't exactly move the needle on my RPMs.\n",
      "line is: I found myself sitting in the middle of a bedroom floor surrounded by atavistic morons, with a redhead on opiates who was convinced she could read my thoughts and tell me my future. That would have been simple: the future had me trying to escape this fucking awful \"party.\" The redhead, who we will call Janice, was equal parts pretentious, innocuous, and full of shit. Janice was an actress (an actress in LA . . . what were the odds?) and was trying out for a role in a health food commercial. Judging by the shape she was in, I could have told her that she had an ice cube's chance in Cuba of making that dream a reality. She looked more like Wynonna Judd than Julianne Moore, complete with the face of a long-haired Clint Eastwood squinting into the desert sun. But being a respectful prick, I kept it to myself, kindly wished her luck in her endeavors, and made to take my leave of it all, grabbing for the front doorknob with one hand and dialing for a cab on my cell phone with the other. Unfortunately Janice wasn't done with me, much to my chagrin. I explained to her I was leaving; she asked whether she could catch a ride back to her apartment. Knowing full well that nothing was going to happen with this person, I said sure.\n",
      "line is: It was then that Charles came stumbling up in all of his embarrassing glory. I had noticed him lurking around the fringes of the \"party\" like a sort of B-Movie actor trying too hard to play a rock-and-roll vampire. Picture Ed Wood meets Jim Morrison and it all starts to tragically make sense. He was dressed in black leather pants on a Thursday. Even I know that's just not cricket—if he were trying to be ironic, I might have cut him some slack. But I don't think Charles could have spelled \"ironic.\" To complete this ensemble, he'd matched these pants up with a sleeveless Ratt T-shirt, a black suit jacket, low-top tennis shoes, and a blue bandana that was more Bret Michaels than Axl Rose. Basically he was shooting for the Izzy Stradlin outfit without being as cool as Izzy Stradlin. Now, I can't say much when it comes to fashion; I myself have a tendency to take good clothes and make bad decisions with them. But even compared to my fashion disasters, this guy looked like a douche pickle soaked in toilet water.\n",
      "line is: His behavior wasn't helping his Q points at all. He'd been making attempts to engage in conversation with almost everyone, but once he joined a group, he didn't say anything. He just stood there, leaning in a little too close, staring alternately right into your eyes and directly into your chest, leaving the cluster of folks mired with uncomfortable silence and bad breath. When he did say something, all he did was try to pimp his band. But it all came out garbled in vowel sounds and hand gestures. It was as if a rookie mime wanted to hand you a demo tape. At the time I didn't know he was on heroin; I just thought he was wasted—perhaps he'd even resorted to snorting Clorox in the bathroom when all the jubilant goodies were gone. I didn't find out about the heroin until Janice told me later, but we'll get to that. At that moment I just wasn't impressed. Naturally I wasn't very stoked about giving him a ride anywhere. But I was still buzzed enough to be talked into worse shit than that, so I said okay. The cab arrived, I ushered them into the backseat, and I jumped up front. We were all three going separate places, but I assured the cabbie I had ample funds so he would be taken care of.\n",

      "line is: The present work seeks to provide a plain narrative of the events of one crowded year. Interwoven by cause and effect, framed in time and space, they embraced the whole Mediterranean world and created the second dynasty of imperial Rome. The web is intricate and colourful. That an attempt to retell the story nineteen hundred years later is possible at all is largely due to the chance survival of the early books of Tacitus' _Histories_ , supported by other information in as generous (or as meagre) a bulk as the historian of ancient Rome can now hope to enjoy. But the Long Year provides us with a thousand problems—dark corners into which only a dim light penetrates from feeble candles, and which we think we can explore by inference, conjecture and imagination. We dispose of no exhaustive official records or revealing memoirs. All the literary sources are liable to be rhetorical, partisan, moralizing or trivial. From the rest industry and scholarship can glean a few straws in a field whose once abundant harvest has irrevocably vanished.\n",
      "line is: It might seem an enterprise of folly and conceit to tread in the footsteps of Tacitus, whose narrative of this time often withstands the sharpest criticism. But, readers are not senators of Rome living forty years after the Long Year. Expansion or contraction is called for. Yet I have not scrupled on occasion to echo his words and emulate, if with a difference, the way in which he cunningly arranges his material. Unlike some of his successors, he is invariably an elegant writer, easier to parody than imitate. But in him drama and emotion, the sly thrust, the style that dominates the matter, above all the _studium_ and _liuor_ from which he imagined himself to be free—these are too overpowering for modern taste. Such elements, therefore, I have reduced, assuming that Roman politicians and leaders were no less open to cool reason than we, no less guided in their day-to-day decisions by careful calculation based on available knowledge and resources. This assumption, which is merely an act of faith, seems not infrequently to suggest verdicts and solutions rather different from those of Tacitus, and, when supported by evidence he did not use, helps to fill some of his silences.\n",

Nor must I forget the University itself, which in years gone by has assisted me to travel in Tacitean territories, and more recently in respect of typing facilities. It is unnecessary to state that all errors and shortcomings in this book are due to myself alone.\n",
      "line is: If it were fashionable to observe the formality of a dedication, mine would be twofold: first, to the _manes_ of Cornelius Tacitus, Roman consul, orator and historian; secondly, to the memory of a later historian of Rome, whose brilliance was equalled only by his courtesy and who many years ago suggested that this book should be written: Jérôme Carcopino.\n",
      "line is: The long interval of fourteen years and the kind observations of reviewers have allowed me to detect and correct some slips, and I have taken the opportunity in this Second Edition of supplementing the intentionally meagre annotation of the First. These years have seen the welcome appearance of the fourth and fifth volumes of Heubner's commentary (which however impinge little on A.D. 69) and the first volume (covering _Histories_ I and II) of that of Chilver. These may always be consulted with profit. Add to this accumulation the new Teubner (Leipzig) text of the _Histories_ (1989). Individual studies have shed light here and there, and usually confirm the excellence and reliability of Tacitus.\n",
      "line is: For technical reasons it has been necessary to place most of the new material in a fresh series of notes following the old, a peculiarity which will not, I hope, be found tiresome. I am grateful to the publisher for rescuing the book from oblivion.\n",
      "line is: The principal ancient literary sources for A.D. 69 are the excerpts of Cassius Dio, Books lxiii-lxv (most conveniently in the Loeb edition, with translation by H. B. Foster and E. Cary); Plutarch, _Lives of Galba and Otho_ , edited in 1890 by E. G. Hardy; Suetonius, _Galba, Otho, Vitellius_ and _Vespasian_ ; and Tacitus, _The Histories_. In the 1972–86 re-issues of the Penguin Classics translation of the last-named will be found a fairly complete bibliography of modern studies of the period and the topics involved.\n",
      "line is: The contribution made by epigraphy and specialist studies of all kinds to our understanding of the year is sufficiently obvious. But a special mention must be made of the enormous utility of McCrum and Woodhead's _Select Documents of the Principates of the Flavian Emperors, Including the Year of Revolution: A.D. 68–96_ (Cambridge, 1961) which experdy conveys the resources of many large and inaccessible _corpora_ to the non-expert. But it possesses no index and provides (of set purpose) the barest minimum of comment.\n",
      "line is: The success of Kenneth Wellesley's account of the Year of the Four Emperors, published in 1975, the same year as Peter Greenhalgh's work on the same subject,1 and again in a second edition by the Bristol Classical Press in 1989, was guaranteed. The work was based on twin foundations, rather rare in combination, of a well-written, exciting narrative and sound, meticulous scholarship, the product of many years of detailed study both of the period and of the text. Wellesley also published an edition of Tacitus' text; the Penguin translation of the _Histories_ ; a scholarly commentary on the third book; and a number of articles dealing with the Year and with Tacitus' treatment of it.2\n",
      "line is: The merits of the book were seen at once; the comments of M. A. R. Colledge in the _Classical Review_ 3 must have drawn a large number of potential readers to it, and his comments remain valid. He found the book remarkable and went on to explain why. His reasons were not very different from those that I have already mentioned, but they were elaborated. Above all, Colledge praised the literary merit of the work, including its structure – its departure from the order of Tacitus' narrative to make the reader wait for Vitellius' gruesome, pathetic death. Indeed, Tacitus ended his third book not at the precise end of the year 69 but with the fall of Rome to the Flavian forces and Vitellius' death and, in the very last chapter of all, the emergence of the sinister new Caesar Domitian on to centre stage as he is conducted by the soldiery into his father's house.4 Wellesley, committed to 69, carries his reader on a little into the first days of the new régime.5 Both approaches are valid, that of Tacitus with his sweeping history of twenty-seven years, ending with the death of that same Domitian, that of Wellesley with the dramatic slice of that history that he gives us, a monograph in another Roman style, not far removed from Sallust's _Catiline_ , which ends in its turn by looking foward to the consulships, and the reigns, of Vespasian and Titus.\n",
      "line is: But M. A. R. Colledge concentrated most on what he called the fine style, telling phrase, the wit, and the splendid sweep of the narrative; it was 'convincing, informed, dramatic, and above all authoritative'. 'Wellesley manages to make the reader feel... that he is witnessing the events as they actually unfold, amongst men and women whom he understands only too well.' Then there was Wellesley's insight and attention to detail, over such matters as the time of a moonrise, and on whose faces it shone,6 which made it possible for him to correct Tacitus and other sources 'from his own knowledge of human psychology and his intimate acquaintance with the political and topographical setting'. 'He has not forgotten even those whom the civil wars did not touch.'7 There was special praise for Wellesley's vividness: he was an enthusiastic virtuoso of the military narrative, and Colledge noted that the detailed descriptions of the fighting near Bedriacum and the two battles of Cremona that followed must have been made possible by personal reconnaissance. Wellesley's choice of plates was also warmly received.\n",

      "line is: This is the first volume of an annual year's best science fiction anthology, to be published each spring in a widely available mass market edition. In each volume the best science fiction of that year will be represented. Not fantasy. Not science fantasy. Science fiction: This anthology will contain only stories that a chronic reader would recognize as SF.\n",
      "line is: For decades, until recently, there was usually one or more good year's best anthologies available in paperback in the SF field. The last ones vanished with the deaths of distinguished editors Terry Carr and Donald A. Wollheim. There has been a notable gap. This book fills that need.\n",
      "line is: Furthermore, the existence of more than one year's best anthology in the SF genre has been good for the field. Volumes which differ in taste or in aesthetic criteria clarify and encourage knowledgeable discourse in the field and about the field. Therefore this book announces itself in opposition to the other extant anthologies.\n",
      "line is: Here is the problem. Other books have so blurred the boundaries between science fiction and everything else that it is possible for an observer to conclude that SF is dead or dying out. This book declares that science fiction is still alive; is fertile and varied in its excellences. Most important, SF has a separate and distinct identity within fairly clear boundaries exemplified by the contents of this book.\n",
      "line is: In the magazine stories and original anthologies this past year there was a fair amount of clunky hardish SF and a bunch of stuff, sometimes quite talented, that was published as SF, but was only by courtesy and by association SF. Not, in fact, an unusual year in these regards.\n",
      "line is: What was unusual was that it was a strong year for science fiction and in particular SF of novella length. By my casual count there were fifteen or twenty novellas from Analog, Asimov's, Omni Online, and the original anthologies Far Futures and New Legends, that could justifiably have been included in a year's best volume alone. Every once in a while the SF field has a \"novella renaissance.\" 1995 was one of those years and it looks likely to spill over into 1996. Guess what? You have fallen behind in your reading if you haven't been reading the novellas. I may be off base but I suspect that there were more first-rate SF novellas than first-rate SF novels published in 1995.\n",
      "line is: Overall, the best speculative fiction of all descriptions was published in Interzone, which deservedly won the Hugo award this year. But all the magazines had high spots and high standards. It was not a year to skip, for instance, Tomorrow or Science Fiction Age.\n",
      "line is: Sadly, it was not a notable year for original anthologies (two extraordinary exceptions are mentioned above, to which Full Spectrum 5 is the third). The general thinking was that the original anthologies made the magazines look good. Book publishers are at fault for letting so much unedited stuff get through under usually dazzling covers. How fortunate we are to have the magazines and the magazine editors: Budrys and Dozois, Schmidt, Rusch, Pringle, Cholfin, Datlow, Edelman, Killheffer and the rest. We had better treasure and support them, and buy and read their magazines, or we won't have them much longer. For the time being they, and the writers, have given us a bright moment.\n",
      "line is: James Patrick Kelly is the author of many SF stories and novels, including the recent novel Wildlife. One thinks of his novella, \"Mr. Boy,\" which makes up the first part of that novel, as a high point in SF from the early 1990s. He is one of the more sophisticated of the younger SF writers from the last decade or two (he attended the Clarion SF workshop in the same group as Bruce Sterling), and seems just now in the 1990s to be achieving full command of his impressive talents. He has a clear graceful style and a willingness to do the hard work of making the science in his stories count. Never a prolific writer, Kelly is nevertheless becoming an important one in the SF field. This story, from Asimov's SF, is in the classic hard SF mode and is in fact in dialogue with the touchstone of hard SF reading, Tom Godwin's controversial \"The Cold Equations.\" I have chosen to place it first to set the tone for this volume. For some readers this will be the best story of the year.\n",
      "line is: Kamala Shastri came back to this world as she had left it—naked. She tottered out of the assembler, trying to balance in Tuulen Station's delicate gravity. I caught her and bundled her into a robe with one motion, then eased her onto the float. Three years on another planet had transformed Kamala. She was leaner, more muscular. Her fingernails were now a couple of centimeters long and there were four parallel scars incised on her left cheek, perhaps some Gendian's idea of beautification. But what struck me most was the darting strangeness in her eyes. This place, so familiar to me, seemed almost to shock her. It was as if she doubted the walls and was skeptical of air. She had learned to think like an alien.\n",

A night of heavy rain had washed the streets clean without, mercifully, overloading the sewer system, and the cobbles and brickwork of the city glistened proudly like a man showing off his freshly cut and oiled hair. Sherlock knew it wouldn't last for long, but for a while it made London into somewhere he thought he could live, one day.\n",
      "line is: Sherlock and his tutor, Amyus Crowe, had left Farnham earlier that morning. Sherlock's brother Mycroft had invited them for lunch at his club – the Diogenes. His reason, which he explained in a letter that had arrived the day before, was that he wanted to talk about Sherlock's schooling. Having been removed from Deepdene School for Boys and placed in the care of the big American Amyus Crowe, it seemed to Sherlock that Mycroft was now wondering if he had done the right thing. Mr Crowe was a brilliant teacher, but only on certain subjects. Survival in the wilderness, tracking animals, fishing for carp and trout, identifying poisonous fungi, a little bit of recent political history and the logical analysis of evidence – these were all his strong points. Mathematics and Latin – not so much.\n",
      "line is: Sherlock would much rather study the things that Amyus Crowe was teaching him, because he could see their value, but his brother had a strange regard for those areas of the syllabus for which Sherlock could see no earthly use. Every now and then he threatened to bring in another tutor to complement Crowe's lessons, and Sherlock had either to avoid the subject entirely or try to talk him out of it. 'If you want to make something of yourself,' he would say, 'then you need to learn dead languages, theology and the more obscure facts of history. There is no alternative, I'm afraid.' The fact that Sherlock had no idea what he wanted to make of himself cut no ice with his brother. 'You will go into the Civil Service, of course,' he would rumble. 'Either that or banking.'\n",
      "line is: The hansom cab that Sherlock and Crowe had taken from Waterloo Station dropped them outside the Diogenes Club, which lurked behind an unremarkable door. Crowe, resplendent in his white suit and hat, flicked a coin up to the driver and strode across the pavement to the door, but as he did so a passing man in a suit and bowler hat jostled against him. Crowe turned to deliver a sharp rebuke, but the man unexpectedly pushed him in the chest. Crowe staggered backwards into two other men who were passing. Within moments, all four men were arguing.\n",
      "line is: Unsure what to do, Sherlock stepped away from the cab. As he did so he heard movement behind him. Someone had come around the side of the cab and was looming at his shoulder. He turned his head, but liquid sprayed his eyes and nose. Gasping, he raised a hand to wipe his face clear, but his arm suddenly seemed to be moving in slow motion. His attention became fixated on his fingers and thumb. They looked like they weren't even a part of him: pink, fleshy things that moved of their own accord. The lines on his palm took on the appearance of rivers crossing a landscape, like a map seen at a distance.\n",
      "line is: He felt nauseous. His head felt like it had doubled in weight, and as he laboriously swung it around to look for Amyus Crowe he saw that the big American was staring at him in concern, but Crowe's face was swimming in and out of focus, and although his lips were moving Sherlock couldn't hear anything apart from what sounded like the tolling of a distant bell. The cab and the sky and the brickwork of the buildings were all bleeding together into a mishmash of colours that made him feel as if he was looking at the world through a stained-glass window. He needed to rest, to sit down and gather his wits, but when he took a step forward his feet tangled together and he stumbled. He fell, and it seemed to take an awfully long time before he hit the ground. A hand grabbed at his shoulder, but when he looked up, all he could see was a grotesquely distorted face looming over him. He struck out with his fists, again and again, flailing around in a world of jumbled shapes and colours. Someone was screaming, and he thought he recognized the voice. He thought it was his own voice, but it was a long, long way away.\n",
      "line is: Then there was darkness, and the feeling that his arms were being tightly held. And then there was just the darkness.\n",
      "line is: The realization that he was lying on a bed of straw in a brick-lined room came slowly. He didn't know at what point he understood where he was: there came a moment, as he was staring at the brickwork, that he realized that he _had_ understood some time ago, but the information just hadn't meant anything to him.\n",
      "line is: He was in a brick room, and he was lying on straw. That was a starting point.\n",
      "line is: The rest seeped back gradually, like the sea washing over the beach as the tide comes in. The Diogenes Club. The cab. The fight. The liquid that had been sprayed over his face.\n",
      "line is: He checked his clothes, running his hands down his body. He was still wearing the same jacket, shirt and trousers that he had been wearing earlier. That, at least, was something to hold on to. They were stained with dust and dirt, but not ripped.\n",

A clinical psychologist, she had a thriving private practice and at the same time had established something of a public persona as host of a popular radio program, Ask Dr. Susan, that aired each weekday.\n",

She had spent most of Saturday and Sunday in Rye with her mother, who had been in low spirits—understandably so, Susan thought, since Sunday would have been her fortieth wedding anniversary. Then, not helping the general situation, Susan had had an unfortunate encounter with her older sister, Dee, who was visiting from California.\n",

Susan suspected that the timing of the party was Binky's doing. \"We had our first date four years ago today,\" she had gushed.\n",

      "line is: Susan was usually the first to arrive on the top floor, but as she passed the law offices of her old friend and mentor, Nedda Harding, she was startled to see that the lights in the reception area and hallway were already on. She knew Nedda had to be the early bird.\n",
      "line is: She shook her head ruefully as she opened the outer door—which should have been locked—walked down the hallway past the still-dark offices of Nedda's junior partners and clerks, then stopped at the open door leading to Nedda's office, and smiled. As usual, Nedda was concentrating so intensely that she was not even aware that Susan was standing there.\n",
      "line is: Nedda was frozen in her usual work pose, her left elbow on the desk, forehead resting on her palm, and her right hand poised to turn the pages of the thick file that was spread out before her. Nedda's short-clipped silver hair was already rumpled, her half glasses were slipping down her nose, and her solid body gave the impression of being ready to leap up and run. One of the most respected defense attorneys in New York, her somewhat grandmotherly appearance offered little indication of the cleverness and aggressive energy she brought to her work, never more apparent than when she cross-examined a witness in court.\n",

      "line is: By the age of thirty-five Tristram Heade had become what is known rather condescendingly as a \"confirmed bachelor.\" (Which did not rule him out from being, in the eyes of certain parties, an \"eligible bachelor\" as well.) In his imagination he still saw himself in the conventional, yet romantic role of American husband, father, homeowner, citizen; like a man who believes himself an intrepid explorer of the brotherhood of Magellan, Marco Polo, and Admiral Perry, yet whose explorations are confined to the tracing of imaginary voyages on maps drawn up by others, Tristram naively yet hopefully spoke of \"someday marrying\" or, no less vaguely, of \"finding the right woman.\" Or, with a frowning little smile: \"I suppose I really mean a woman who would have _me_.\"\n",
      "line is: Of course he hoped for children too. Particularly sons, to carry on the family name. But the purely physical (that is, the purely sexual) channel by which children must come into the world was daunting to him, to consider. For Tristram had had very few sexual experiences in his life, and none had been altogether satisfying.\n",
      "line is: Yet women liked him; were drawn to him; confided in him, asked advice of him, sought sympathy from him. The mothers of Richmond debutantes whose seasons were rapidly receding particularly sought him out, in those years when Tristram accepted invitations more readily. It was noted that, living alone in his parents' house, Tristram was becoming, by degrees, rather unsociable and reclusive. But he remained a Virginia Heade, after all, and therefore a person of importance: the last living male issue of a stock descended from Erasmus Heade, the Revolutionary War general; a gentleman to his fingertips; courteous, soft-spoken, modest, and irreproachable in his morals. Not a handsome man in the usual sense of the word he was nonetheless attractive in his big-boned, rather self-conscious way; he was the kind of man at whom people stare, bemused, or frankly perplexed, as if trying to remember his name. He had the look of being someone's cousin: a _presence_ mysteriously lacking _identity_.\n",
      "line is: \"It is as if my normal life, my 'real' life, had somehow been deflected from me,\" Tristram once said, in a fumbling attempt to explain himself to a young female cousin named Abigail, who had taken a kindly interest in him. \"'Deflected'—how? By who?\" Abigail asked. \"That's just it,—I don't know how, and I don't know by who,\" Tristram said, shrugging. Abigail looked at him quizzically, as if he were a riddle to be deciphered. She was a very pretty girl, engaged to a West Point cadet, and primed for all that life, in the social class to which she belonged both by birth and temperament, had to offer. \"But what exactly do you mean, Tristram?\" Abigail asked. \"You have a 'real' life somewhere else, and your life now, your life here, as the Tristram we all know, is false? Or your life here is the only life you know, and the other is—what? Lost? Inaccessible?\" Tristram smiled in embarrassment, eager to change the subject. \"I don't know,\" he said simply. \"It all happened before I was born.\"\n",
      "line is: Though his family's fortune had dwindled over the years, with a rude, precipitous drop in the late 1970s, it seemed to be known about town that Tristram had inherited enough to live comfortably on, if he had wished to live comfortably; he could marry if he chose, and support a wife and children, even without working as a lawyer. He had stopped attending services since his mother's death, but remained a financially supportive member of the First Episcopal Church of Richmond; this held him in good stead with the community. He was known to have no vices, no bad habits, no eccentricities... at least, no eccentricities not amenable to reform.\n",
      "line is: \"If Tristram would only marry,\" his mother said, in her final, exhausting illness, when she spoke tactlessly, sometimes even recklessly, sensing how little time remained, \"—all might yet be well. But he must _hurry_. After I am gone he will need someone to _take over_.\"\n",
      "line is: Tristram's mother had loved him very much; and Tristram had loved his mother. Yet, in the months following her death, he began to forget her; as, to his surprise, and dismay, he'd forgotten his father shortly after _his_ death. I mean to be a dutiful son, Tristram thought,—but what is my duty?\n",
      "line is: It was strange, how, in the two or three rooms of the twenty-room house (a small mansion, really) at Royalston Place, which constituted Tristram's house-within-a-house, he seemed to thrive, like a tough, sinewy, weedy plant. Chicory, perhaps: the hardiest of weeds, growing in thin dirt, or in gravel, yet with sky-blue flowers of exquisite beauty. While others may have worried over him, Tristram never worried about himself because he did not think overmuch about _himself_. A cloistered life has the advantage of silence, and silence spares us echoes. The primary focus of a day spent at Royalston Place was nearly always the arrival of the morning's mail, which, delivered anywhere between ten-thirty and noon, rarely failed to contain a bookdealer's catalogue or brochure, or a letter from a fellow collector. (Tristram wrote regularly to some twenty-odd people, all men, only a few of whom he had actually met.) Of course, the most exciting days were those when Tristram received a new purchase, ordered and paid for by mail. The 1722 edition of _Tyburn Calendar; or Malefactor's Bloody Register_ , published by Swindell's of Hanging Bridge, London; a 1685 edition of Dryden's _Tyrannic Love_ ; a 1778 edition of the anonymous English translation of _The Infamous History of \"Count Cagliostro\"_ —at such times Tristram's happiness was direct and unbounded as a child's.\n",
      "line is: His parents did indeed rapidly recede into the past, like comets hurtling themselves into an unfathomable ether. In time they became confused in Tristram's book-bemused memory with his grandparents; and they, with _their_ parents, whom Tristram had not known, of course, except as daguerreotypes and family legend had preserved them. Similarly, both sides of the family, his mother's (her maiden name was Buchanan: she too was descended from an illustrious ancestor, a confidant of George Washington's during his presidency) and his father's, became confused in his memory; as things, valuable in themselves, like cuff links, gold watches, tie clips, and the like, seem to lose their value by being jumbled together in a drawer. (Like certain drawers in Tristram's quarters, in fact.)\n",
      "line is: Tristram's interest in antiquarian books began in early adolescence, when, overweight and shy to the point of pain, he spent a good deal of time in his grandfather Heade's library; a walnut-paneled book-lined place of enormous solace and comfort. Books, Tristram quickly learned, were his friends: they never failed in time of need. Miserable at the prospect of, or, what was worse, the fresh memory of, his clumsiness at one or another tea-dance or family gathering, he could hide himself in his grandfather's library for hours at a time. His father did not approve, of course; it was Mr. Heade's directive that guided Tristram to the University of Virginia, for his undergraduate work, and law school. But books, as they are our friends, are not jealous lovers, who forsake us for having forsaken them: while Tristram tried his hand (or his brain) at the wise, adept, fairly cruel ways of the world, he knew in his innermost heart that his truer life was elsewhere, awaiting him.\n",

      "line is: It may be the only time on record when a young man in a tavern has insisted, not that he was old enough to drink, but that he was not old enough to stop drinking.\n",
      "line is: It happened in Andalusia, in the Muslim-ruled south of Spain. We can't say exactly where. It could have been in Córdoba, or in Granada, or in Seville, or in any of the other towns that the young man passed through and lived in after leaving the Christian north as an adolescent. We can't say exactly when it happened, either. Since the young man was born sometime between 1070 and 1075, we know only that it was toward the end of the eleventh century. This was a time—a thousand years after the destruction of the Second Temple, eight hundred years after the redaction of the Mishnah, and five hundred years after the compilation of the Babylonian Talmud—in which 90 percent of the world's Jews lived in a Muslim expanse that stretched from the Atlantic coasts of Spain and Morocco to the Indian subcontinent, and from Yemen to the Aral Sea. Andalusia was in the far northwestern corner of this vast territory, pressing against and pressed back on by Christian Europe. It had been a part of the Islamic realm ever since Arab and Berber warriors from North Africa stormed the Straits of Gibraltar in 711 and conquered most of Spain.\n",
      "line is: If the night was warm and rainless, as most Andalusian nights are, the young man was probably sitting at a table out-of-doors, in an interior courtyard of the sort still found everywhere in the south of Spain. (What tourist to the region has not seen, on a street of seemingly plain houses, a door swing open and shut on a gardened patio like the tantalizing flash of a secret existence?) Perhaps, if it was springtime, a blossoming orange or lemon tree gave off its sweet-and-sour scent. The young man was unlikely to have been drinking alone, since he was too popular to be left by himself for long. From a neighboring table, an admirer sent a jug of wine. The young man thanked him with a poem. It may have been written afterwards and delivered by a messenger. Yet judging by the young man's gifts and the art of poetic improvisation in Muslim Spain, it was most probably composed on the spot and carried back by the waiter who had brought the wine. It went, in a free English translation:\n",
      "line is: In Hebrew, the language in which this poem was written, the young man's punning avowal that he was under twenty-four (which need not mean he was twenty-three; he could just as well have been sixteen or seventeen) works differently from my English rendition. Traditionally, each of the Hebrew consonants has a numerical value, and the word _kad_ , \"jug,\" is composed of the letters _kaf_ , which stands for twenty, and _dalet_ , which stands for four. Literally, then, the poem's last two lines read:\n",
      "line is: Its pun aside, the young man's poem obeyed complex rules, since not only was the Hebrew verse of his day required to have meter and rhyme, its standards for both were more stringent than those of formal English poetry. Regardless of its length, a poem in the classical style was allowed only a single mono-rhyme, with which each of its lines had to end. When it came to meter, on the other hand, a poet had to choose among a dozen possible patterns, each consisting of a rigidly adhered-to alteration of \"long\" and \"short\" syllables. For this particular poem, the young man chose the meter, known as the _marnin_ or \"allegro,\" _short-long-long-long, short-long-long-long, short-long-long_ , a single sequence of which made up the half-lines or hemistiches into which each of the poem's full lines was divided.\n",
      "line is: Dashing off, amid the hubbub of a tavern, a poem so demanding yet wittily accomplished would have been an impressive feat. It would not have ranked, however, as a singular one. Talented poets in Andalusia were expected to do such things. It is told of Shmuel Hanagid (993—1056), the first of the great Hispano-Hebrew poets, that he once had quoted to him a couplet on the subject of biting into an apple. Not to be outdone, he proceeded to compose, one after another, fifteen short but perfectly constructed poems on the same theme before running out of time, breath, or inspiration.\n",
      "line is: Indeed, if calling an age \"poetic\" refers, not to some supposed collective sublimity or imaginativeness of mind, but, more mundanely, to the widespread use of poetry in ordinary life as a medium of communication and social exchange, the young man was born in one of the most historically poetic of ages. When, for instance, the same Shmuel Hanagid decided one spring day in Granada to throw a party for his friends, the invitations he sent out were in the form of a poem telling them to \"Take note, make haste, and do not fail / To gather in my garden.\" But this would have been only the beginning. Hanagid's invitees might have informed him of their acceptance by sending him a poem in return; some might have turned up at his door with poems as gifts; if there were toasts or speeches, these would have been in poetic form, too; any party games played would have included competitions in which the guests were asked to write a poem on the same theme or having the same formal properties; and a good time having been had, poems would be sent as thank-you notes. It was a world in which, in cultivated circles, no solemn occasion and no occurence of note went without a poem to commemorate it; in which friends wrote each other letters in poetry or, if they were in a hurry, in a more easily composed rhymed prose; in which the ability to pen a creditable poem was considered as indispensable a part of an education as filling out a job application is in our own age. A poet who was more than merely creditable was a sought-after figure, often supported by wealthy patrons for whom he wrote verse to order.\n",
      "line is: In the Arabic-speaking Jewish society in which our young man lived, the language of these poems was always Hebrew. Yet the central role accorded to poetry did not stem originally from a Jewish impulse. Its history went back to the preliterate life of the Arabian desert, whose Bedouin tribes had poured out of it following the founding of Islam in the early seventh century and rapidly overrun much of the world under the new religion's martial banner. Among these desert nomads, the ability to extemporize verse had always been valued greatly. Poems were an everyday vehicle for the expression of emotion; for the sending of messages and requests; for the carrying of news from one encampment to another; for the recording and remembering of unusual events; for the wooing of the opposite sex; for the enhancement of celebrations; for the flattering of authority; for the vaunting of one's exploits; for the praising of one's friends and the derogation of one's enemies, and the like. The popular poetry tournaments held at the commercial fairs of pre-Islamic times testified to the regard in which gifted poetic improvisers were held—and when, at moments of high drama or strong feeling, characters in medieval Arabic prose narratives like _One Thousand and One Nights_ break into poetic speech, they are harking back to the traditions of the desert.\n",
      "line is: The cosmopolitan culture of the great Islamic cities of the East, such as Baghdad, Damascus, and Cairo, with their class of professional poets supported by the patronage of royalty and wealth, was far removed from Bedouin life. Yet the special place of poetry persisted in Arab society and spread from the East to Andalusia. The annals of Muslim Spain are replete with stories that illustrate how readily men and women were moved to, and swayed by, poetic diction. The eleventh-century poet-king of Seville, Ala'llahi Al-Mu'tamid, we are told, owed his marriage to this propensity. Once, as a young prince, he was sailing on the Guadalquivir River with a friend when, struck by the ripples on it, he spontaneously exclaimed, _Sana'a 'r-rihu min el-mai zarad_ , \"The wind has spun a coat-of-mail from the water,\" and challenged his companion to add a second line. Some slave girls were doing their laundry on the riverbank, and while the friend racked his brain, one of them, a stunning beauty who had overheard the prince's challenge, called back across the water, _Eyyu dir'in li-qitalin low qamad_ , \"What armor for battle if it stiffened!\" Al-Mu'tamid was so taken by her cleverness and looks that he bought her from her master and married her. She was to be the love of his life.\n",
      "line is: Jewish Andalusia was not an exact replica of its Muslim surroundings. But while Jews in the Muslim world lived, on the whole, within a social framework of their own, they were more heavily influenced by their host culture than any previous rabbinically regulated Jewish society in the Diaspora. This was why Hebrew poetry, which was modeled on its Arabic counterpart in form and content, was so important to them, and why our young man had left home in his teens to seek his literary fortune in Spain's south, where the art of poetry was more advanced.\n",
      "line is: In the Christian north in which he was born and raised, he had received a solid Jewish education. In those days, this meant amassing a far greater fund of knowledge than a Jewish day-school or yeshiva student would be expected to acquire in our own age, one that included a thorough mastery of Hebrew and its grammar, a comprehensive familiarity with the Bible, a rigorous training in the Talmud and rabbinic texts, and a detailed acquaintance with Jewish religious law. In fact, it is likely that, by the time he set out for Andalusia, our young man had acquired the title of \"rabbi\" that was frequently prefixed to his name in later life. This did not mean that he ever was considered, or acted as, a religious authority. A rabbinic ordination was routinely granted to anyone who had progressed far enough in his studies, and signified little more than a college degree does today.\n",

He thinks he's so great, that divorced Dad, in his green Audi Fox. With his golf clubs and tennis racket and bald head. You know the mom went and got super into Jesus, and now they all go to that weird huge church on the other end of the valley that people call a superchurch.

      "line is: There was a bridge maker. He made bridges that people put in their earlobes and around their fingers. Tiny little bridges. Decorated and beautiful and perfect. He decided that when he died he would request a thin bridge fixed to his casket helping to connect him to his dead family under the ground.\n",
      "line is: His living family insisted that he leave a real legacy. He was famous for small things. They wanted him to be known for big things. So he built a real bridge. Paid for by the Yankees—not to honor his memory, but really for their own convenience. Like everything new. Huge and stretching from Guyana—the place in the world most south—to Miami—the place in the world most north. Before allowing the public to walk on the bridge he gathered all his family onto it for a picture. But the bridge was built like his others, the only way he knew how, delicate and pretty but not able to bear weight.\n",

She passed waterfalls and rivers and waterfalls; symbols of life, she knew. She walked fast—she felt she could live forever. In St. Thomas she'd felt she would die.

All of the Caribbean was talking about it. The next stretch was planned for the British Virgin Islands, though the ferrymen complained and complained that they would go out of business. Proposals were in motion for the Bahamas and the ABC islands. A bridge soon to be under construction between Trinidad and Tobago. Next St. Kitts and Nevis. Bridges connecting the whole region.\n",

Some portions were too dense, others rarefied almost to a vacuum. Though frozen in some places, in others it boiled. Under these conditions it was almost impossible to judge the correct form of objects on the planet. What was actually a sphere might appear now as an elongated cone, now a parallelogram, now a rod; it might even be seen to sway limply like a strand of sea grass. Over hundreds of millions of years, however, the air eventually homogenized and these aberrations in the refraction of light disappeared.

It was transparent, exactly like an inverted icicle, in brilliant outline against a blue sky.

No, she thought, for all the beauty it has to offer, the primeval atmosphere isn't easy for human beings to bear. Yet she was not in any great pain herself, she was only a little chilly, and her chest felt constricted.\n",

She was sure the atmosphere accounted for the way it looked; more likely, though, 'Fuji' had been the only name to come to mind when she faced a transparent mountain that had existed since time immemorial.

      "line is: On Saturday afternoons, after school was out, Kōko had to hear piano lessons, five very young pupils at a time for an hour each. She would work her way along the row of five rooms, listening to their Hanon, their Bach, their Burgmüller, with a word of advice for each one – lower your wrists, your left hand is too heavy, keep the tempo slow – until she could no longer tell the tunes apart. Wearily she would motion a child aside, play the set piece herself, and send the children home with instructions to practice the same thing for next week. They were happy to go. Not one of her pupils liked the piano; in fact even those who'd enjoyed it at first came to hate it after a few sessions. This system is just too awful, Kōko often thought. But I'd never pass for a teacher otherwise. And she would avert her eyes from the children. In any case it wasn't doing them positive harm. Still, in spite of herself, she would find them gradually setting her nerves on edge. Why does that boy make such a performance of yawning? Why does that girl have such stiff fingers?

Of course she has to, she couldn't expect to make ends meet otherwise, so she should stop being so stubborn and simply come and live here. We'd be delighted to have her.

The enticement of romance, the lure of gold and diamonds, wanderlust, a desire to face the tiger in the jungles of Bengal, the reputed unerring precision of the mongoose in subduing the cobra, or even a sneaking suspicion that there is a catch somewhere in that tall \"rope-trick story\"; these and many others are mingled together as elements in a hazy picture of India. While there is a basic residuum of truth in such a conception, a correct understanding of the complexity of modern India is impossible without some historical knowledge of the cultural evolution of the country.\n",
      "line is: The cultural history of India begins with the Aryan invasion. Leaving aside for the moment the vague origins of what is now one of the oldest cultures of the world, we may profitably summarize the high points of India's later history. Although thousands of miles away from Europe, India has figured recurrently in historic times as the goal of a succession of military conquests from the Western world. Blazing new trails and overcoming great obstacles, Alexander the Great of Macedon subjugated the northwestern regions of India in 326 B.C. He came not to establish a kingdom, but merely to conquer. Like a bird of passage he disappeared soon after his arrival. The cultural influence of this invasion survives today in some of the architectural monuments of North India.\n",
      "line is: During the next great wave of conquest, which began in the eleventh century and finally culminated in the establishment of the Mohammedan Empire, Europe lost contact with India. But with the breakup of feudal Europe and the beginning of the modern era of Western expansion, a sea route to India was discovered by the Portuguese. After a period of struggle for power between the various nations of Europe, the English established their rule and built an Indian Empire on the ruins of that of the Mohammedans, which had been slowly disintegrating since the beginning of the eighteenth century. The coming of the English to India was in many respects different from the previous conquests, in that two distinct cultures came into intimate contact with one another. After the consolidation of their political power, English scholars were not slow in initiating research in various directions to reconstruct India's past.\n",
      "line is: What strikes any keen student of present-day India is its incomprehensible diversity. It is a veritable museum of beliefs, a finely interwoven tapestry of multifarious sects and secret rites. Side by side with the most abstruse and sublime metaphysical speculations about the nature of reality, one may see primitive animistic beliefs and worship of natural forces. The introduction of Western education has made these anachronisms all the more incongruous. Until recently, for example, there existed in a section of the country a hospital for rats endowed by public subscription! What can be more paradoxical to the Westerner than the sight of painted, sacred bulls mingling nonchalantly with the pedestrians on the streets of Calcutta, the second largest city in the British Empire?\n",
      "line is: Social life is even more incomprehensible–a rigid caste system, with the Untouchables at the bottom and the Brahmins at the top, is the very bedrock of Indian civilization. The rigidity of such social stratification is to be seen in two communities of fishermen in a certain section where the members of one weave their nets from right to left and the other from left to right; there is no intermarriage between the two groups.\n",
      "line is: Religion, like salt in the ocean, pervades all aspects of life. Because of the religious sanction which underlies all social institutions, caste has continued to flourish for centuries in spite of the moral and material degradation to which a vast number of India's population has been consigned. Even highway robbery was once considered as having religious sanction. A \"thug\" in American newspapers is an armed robber. But the name is derived from a North Indian community of the last century, whose members not only gained a livelihood through armed robbery but considered it a religious duty.\n",
      "line is: The contradiction between theory and practice and the wide prevalence of the most barbaric social customs and religious practices alongside sublime philosophic thought and ideals of self-abnegation have led many modern observers to contradictory evaluations of India's culture. But this contradiction would fade away on deeper analysis. The sociologist and the social psychologist aim to understand culture. They are not averse to introducing changes in society, though they do not consider it their province. On the other hand, reformers all over the world have one thing in common, namely a desire to change existing institutions when they have outlived their usefulness. Their praise and blame are influenced by relative standards of what is, or what is not, desirable. A modern example may help us here. The reformers of the extreme left today attribute all the ills of society to the private ownership of the means of production, hence, they clamor for a collectivist society. But such an attitude does not help us to understand how and why private ownership became an economic institution all over the world. To comprehend this, it is necessary to study the various factors which influence the evolution of changing relationships in the means of production. Without an understanding of the past the present becomes inexplicable.\n",
      "line is: Gradual evolution from lower to higher forms is the pivotal truth of biology; forms of thought and attitudes toward life, religion, and philosophy are also better understood in terms of evolution. Ancient Greece and Rome are dead, but who would deny that the legacy of these two civilizations may be traced in modern Europe and America? The exaggerated dictum that nothing moves in the world that is not Greek in origin may be true of the West, but it is equally true that India moves on foundations that are thoroughly Hindu in origin.\n",
      "line is: With the exception of the Chinese, Indian civilization is the only one that has come down to us from antiquity with an unbroken tradition. Conquerors may have come and gone and at Delhi may be seen the ruins of half a dozen empires, but the culture of India has remained untouched through the ages. In spite of repeated political convulsions, religious reforms, and foreign invasions, the spirit of Hindu culture today is not very different from what it was centuries ago. Today, after nearly two centuries of British rule, the ways of the man in the street remain unchanged. Politically and economically, in India, as everywhere else, threatening clouds are gathering on the horizon. Whether this will lead to a disintegration of the age-old Hindu culture remains to be seen. The words of the English historian, V. A. Smith, are very significant in this connection:\n",
      "line is: European writers, as a rule, have been more conscious of the diversity than of the unity of India. . . . India beyond all doubt possesses a deep underlying fundamental unity, far more profound than that produced either by geographical isolation or by political suzerainty. That unity transcends the innumerable diversities of blood, colour, language, dress, manners, and sect.\n",
      "line is: It is generally believed that the important factor which makes for this unity has been the Hindu religion and its philosophical tenets. And so, if we are to understand yoga, which is an important part of the philosophical tradition, in its natural setting in Hindu thought and with a correct perspective, it is necessary to trace briefly the history of this culture with reference to religion and philosophy.\n",

      "line is: I first came across Yves Meynard around the turn of the millennium with the short story \"Tobacco Words\" (which you will find in this collection) in a Year's Best anthology. It blew me away. I immediately went to see what else Meynard had written and found the novel _The Book of Knights_ (1998), which I acquired and enjoyed. By the time I moved to Montreal in 2002 and actually met Yves, I was a big fan of his work.\n",
      "line is: Yves is a big guy with a square head and close-cropped hair. He says himself he looks as if he's drawn by Picasso. He's funny and witty and considerate and kind, all of which you might guess from reading his work.\n",
      "line is: When I first met him, I was both thrilled and horrified to discover that most of his writing was in French, and that he's just as much of a stylist in French as he is in English, and also that (like my other favourite Francophone writer, Elisabeth Vonarburg) I was going to have to either wait for translations of his work or improve my French a lot.\n",
      "line is: Yves, like many Montrealers, speaks both official Canadian languages with equal facility. Even so, most writers only work in one or the other. I asked him once about writing in both languages, and he told me that he has ideas in one language or the other. This makes perfect sense to me, because ideas come to me with their mode. Still, it seems more impressive to create across languages, and to have the skill with words Yves has to make either language do what he wants.\n",
      "line is: In French, he has long been recognized as a major writer. In English, recognition has been slower, I suspect simply because he hasn't published as much. In 2012, Tor brought out a second novel by Yves in English, _Chrysanthe,_ a high fantasy reminiscent of Dunsany, Zelazny, Eddison, and Wolfe.\n",
      "line is: Now we have this collection, with its fascinating title: _Angels & Exiles_. It contains all of Yves' best short work in English from the last quarter century. Some of these stories are easy to find. Some were entirely new to me. I think some will be new to even his most devoted fans. This is the point where I should single out some of the stories for your attention, but I'm finding it hard to do. I don't want to spoil them at all. I could say there's an android, and a train, but the process of discovering what these things mean is something you should come to yourself.\n",
      "line is: These stories cover a vast range, were written over a long time, and there's a whole lot of variety. Some are fantasy, some are science fiction, and many of them cover an interesting middle ground between the two—a form I think of as myths of the future, and of which Meynard has a special mastery. I do like some of them best; that's inevitable. But taken as a whole, it's a terrific collection. It's always interesting to see a body of work brought together, to see it as one thing, to notice recurring themes and motifs. Here, the theme that resonates most strongly across the stories is the power of hope. Hope is sometimes denied or deferred, but it is never scorned. Sometimes when you read a collection in one piece it reveals flaws that you wouldn't notice in stories read alone, and other times, as here, seeing it together highlights how very good it all is.\n",
      "line is: It's not just that he's a stylist, with every word chosen so perfectly for its purpose that his prose is a joy to read. It's not just that he writes characters who you can care about as if they're your friends, even if they are sparingly evoked in just a few lines. Nor is it his strangely angled and baroque worlds, fascinating as they are. Any one of these things would make his stories worth reading, and they're all present throughout his work. What makes him an exciting writer, what makes me catch my breath time and again when reading his work, is the confluence of these things with the twists he throws on his ideas. I find myself reading along admiring the prose, loving the characters, delighting in the charm of the details, and then suddenly the story comes around an unexpected corner and forces me to reassess everything I was thinking. And that's exciting. It's part of what I want and, I believe, what every genre reader wants from a story—not just the breath of strangeness, but finding a new way of confronting the universe.\n",
      "line is: You'll find that here. I feel confident that you'll enjoy these stories, and that they'll move you. But better than that, there will be moments, and they might be different moments for you than for me, when these stories make you realize that the world isn't the way you thought it was. And when I say that, I don't necessarily mean the world of the story.\n",

      "line is: The black helicopter cut through the air above the skyscrapers of Chicago, moving as swiftly and silently as a deadly eel in calm ocean waters. The buildings below it were simple and beautiful, tall lines of elegant silver steel, concealed concrete and alloy that blended well with the natural beauty of the surrounding landscape and contributed rather than detracted from the environment. There was still concrete aplenty—there will always be concrete—but the heavy, ornate stone and gothic architecture of previous centuries was gone, steel and most of the older, cracked concrete had been swept away by the sleeker, cleaner structures of modern day. The shorelines of Lake Michigan and the Chicago River were lined with green-soaked city parks sporting lush grass and spectacular gardens filled with brilliant landscaping. No smoke or other pollutants threatened the purity of the air, no unnatural clouds marred the crystalline loveliness of the blue sky above the citizens who drank their coffee beneath brightly colored umbrellas and mosaic-covered tables. For as far as the eye could see, nothing disturbed the seamless, balanced blend of mankind and its surroundings—\n",
      "line is: Inside its cockpit, the pilot and copilot worked single-mindedly at the controls, navigating via a bank of liquid crystal screens, watching as the display followed the changing terrain and constantly updated the information about altitude, airspeed, and distance. Dressed in black from head to toe, they were sleek and featureless behind helmets with fitted black visors. Their gloved fingers moved over the buttons and controls with impressive speed and efficiency.\n",
      "line is: \"Coming up,\" the pilot said suddenly. The screen to his right rapid-fired coordinates and a directional grid in a blazing display of red, green, and blue, and his voice was clear over the microphones built into the helmets. \"Holding airspeed.\"\n",
      "line is: \"Echo altitude,\" the copilot responded immediately. \"Forward and lateral drift, numbers falling fast from here.\"\n",
      "line is: \"On my mark,\" the pilot said crisply. \"Three, two, one—\" He jerked his head. _\"Mark!\"_\n",
      "line is: The copilot, whose forefinger had been holding over a red-labeled button slightly off center on the control panel, pressed it firmly. There was a muffled thump behind the two men as the locking mechanism on the back cargo bay door released, then the hydraulics kicked in and the door dropped open. The interior of the slim helicopter filled with the scream of wind and speed. Then, triggered by the opening of the door, seven two-meter black steel balls spun out of recesses in the side walls like oversized bowling balls; following the track set into the floor of the helicopter, they rolled smoothly out the open door and dropped into the sky.\n",
      "line is: The helicopter spun up and away, then disappeared into the distance as the seven spheres plummeted toward a spot just outside the southwest corner of the city, falling into a perfect line as they descended. Direction, descent speed, and wind velocity had all been precalculated, and they hit their target with unfailing precision. While the huge white building would have been difficult to miss, even the strike point itself was predetermined—low on the southernmost corner of one specific building, hitting in a precisely spaced horizontal line running left to right. They punctured the outer walls without even slowing; their momentum kept them going, barreling through metal, wood, plaster, and wallboard, never losing speed and guided by a preprogrammed internal navigation system. Anything in their way was obliterated—furniture reduced to splinters, copiers and high-tech equipment crushed into pieces of fluid-leaking twisted metal, cubicles smashed to kindling. Several puny flesh-and-blood office workers were flattened to little more than wet, red puddles that resembled man-sized blots of dropped gelatin. Finally the spheres reeled to a stop in that same, razor-straight line, dead center in the middle of their target: an enormous laboratory.\n",
      "line is: Too shocked to move, a couple dozen lab workers and scientists gaped as the first of the shining metal spheres suddenly unraveled, opening like a huge steel seed pod. In the next instant a black-clad figure vaulted out of the leftover bands of metal and yanked a three-foot sword from a scabbard at his waistband that was no more than an inch deep; no one within twenty feet had time to decide whether their attacker was a man or woman, and they certainly couldn't call for help or finger an alarm—every last one of them was eviscerated before finishing useless mental questions about gender or spontaneous impulses regarding sirens. By then the other six spheres had split open and spilled their deadly occupants, and within seconds there was no one alive in the room except the seven dark arrivals.\n",
      "line is: The seven figures exchanged glances, their eyes hidden behind day-vision goggles that transformed the sunlight streaming through the skylights overhead to a more bearable night view. Moving in perfect synchrony, they streamed across the room like liquid oil, nimbly avoiding the splayed, red-splattered corpses, aiming for the door at the far end.\n",
      "line is: The high-pitched alarms were going off in every direction, but it took nearly no time at all to negotiate the corridors and get to their main target location—they'd all studied the computer floor plans until, if it had been necessary, any one of them could have found anything in the building from memory right down to a specific floor outlet. The only thing that now stood between them and what they wanted most was the vault door, but the leader's laser pistol beam ate through the metal alloy like it was nothing more than slightly stubborn wax. When the starting and ending edges of the laser wound met, the door seemed to float in place for a long, breathless second; then gravity took over and it tumbled outward with a reverberating _clank!_\n",
      "line is: The seven figures stepped nimbly over the threshold, then they couldn't help pausing. They had been briefed on what to expect, of course, but what they were facing . . . it was more than big, more than huge. It was _monstrous,_ the stepping stone to an industrial complex the likes of which they'd tried but never been successful at imagining.\n",

      "line is: First, the usual caveat: this selection of science fiction stories represents that best that was published during the year 1996. In my opinion, I could have filled two more volumes this size and then claimed to have nearly all of the best—though not all the best novellas.\n",
      "line is: Second, the general criteria: this book is full of science fiction—every story in the book is clearly that and not something else. I personally have a high regard for horror, fantasy, speculative fiction, and slipstream and post-modern literature. But here, I chose science fiction. It is the intention of this year's best series to focus entirely on science fiction, and to provide readers who are looking especially for science fiction an annual home base.\n",
      "line is: One theme that was particularly evident in this year's fiction was respect for the forefathers of science fiction. Since it was one hundred years after the first publication of H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, an original anthology was conceived in honor of the occasion, and the stories in that book filled many magazine pages as well before the book appeared. The gimmick was irresistible to writers: tell a story of the Wellsian Martian invasion in the literary voice and style of a writer contemporary of Wells. Another idea that attracted first-rate writers was to write a story in honor of Jack Williamson, the living Grand Master of SF whose contemporary career began in the 1920 and is still going strong. In addition to these anthologies, there were individual books such as Stephen Baxter's The Time Ships, a sequel to Wells' The Time Machine; and Richard Garfinkle's Celestial Matters, an alternate science alternative history of space adventure among the crystalline spheres of the Ptolemaic universe that looked to the past with respect and wonder.\n",
      "line is: Stephen Baxter, David Langford, and others wrote more individual stories about Jules Verne, Wells, G. K. Chesterton, as forefathers. Perhaps it is a signal of a new evolutionary stage in the literature that the field is aware of diverse literary traditions and of the historical figures, styles, and ideas that have made science fiction what it is today.\n",
      "line is: There was a relative crash in mass market distribution in 1996 that affected all genres, and that hurt SF, too, leading to some fewer titles in mass market by the end of the year and more titles announced in trade paperback—but not as many in 1997 as in earlier years in mass market size. The major magazines were all in transition, with Analog and Asimov's sold to another publisher, Omni ceasing print publication in favor of online issues—a move followed by A. J. Budry's magazine, Tomorrow, at the end of the year. Gordon Van Gelder took over as the new editor of Fantasy & Science Fiction as of January 1997. SF Age was the only magazine that didn't appear to go through some difficult transition in 1996, achieving a new level of quality that challenged both F&SF and Asimov's. The smaller professional magazines were all hurt by the relative collapse of small press distribution over the last few years that continued in 1996. Absolute Magnitude and Pirate Writings continued to publish, as well as On Spec in Canada and Interzone in England, but in spite of editorial excellence, none of them thrived—just survived. Interzone, as usual, maintained its leading position in speculative fiction, and published several fine science fiction stories in the mix.\n",
      "line is: The trend toward novellas I mentioned last year ceased abruptly, with many fewer fitting into the magazines after page cutbacks and fewer individual issues this year (now most monthly magazines publish eleven times a year, including one big double issue). On the other hand, it was a particularly good year for the science fiction short story, with excellent work appearing every month. And I wish to point out that with the exception of anthologies such as the two mentioned above, Ellen Datlow's hybrid reprint/original, fantasy/SF Off Limits, and Patrick Nielsen Hayden's fine Starlight I (the beginning of a new series of original anthologies of new short SF and fantasy), and the long-awaited, extraordinary Tesseracts Q—SF from the French-Canadian for the first time in English—it was another year in which the magazine editors outperformed the anthologists.\n",
      "line is: The world stayed turned upside-down in that the average issue of the major magazines was better than the average contents of the original anthologies. Perhaps one beneficial effect of the distribution cut-backs will be fewer original anthologies and a resurgence of quality control (by which I mean editing) in them. The history of science fiction is filled with landmark anthologies, whose story notes and introductions tell the real history and evolution of the literature. We need more good ones.\n",
      "line is: Dave Wolverton won a Writers of the Future prize at the start of his career and has gone on not only to write many novels and stories of science fiction adventure, but to head the Writers of the Future contest and edit their anthologies himself for the past few years. He is one of the most talented writers of entertaining adventure among younger SF writers, the new generation that appeared at the end of the 1980s. This story is particularly interesting in that it is written as if by Jack London. It was composed for inclusion in War of the Worlds: Global Dispatches, edited by Kevin Anderson, though it first appeared in Fantasy & Science Fiction. The idea was that writers would write reports of the Martian invasion from parts of the world other than Wells' England (an exception is made for Mr. Henry James) as if witnessed by other famous historical personages, such as Pablo Picasso or Albert Einstein. But the writers often took on another challenge: \"After a Lean Winter\" is a Jack London story in the style London would have written it. Other interesting pieces in the book in this vein include Robert Silverberg's Henry James, George Alec Effinger's Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Gregory Benford and David Brin's Jules Verne. Wolverton delivers a virtuoso performance here, an SF writer writing as another SF writer (those of you who have missed London's SF may be in for a treat), in the world of a third writer.\n",
      "line is: Pierre swept into Hidden Lodge on Titchen Creek late on a moonless night. His two sled dogs huffed and bunched their shoulders, then dug their back legs in with angry growls, hating the trail, as they crossed that last stubborn rise. The runners of his sled rang over the crusted snow with the sound of a sword being drawn from its scabbard, and the leather harnesses creaked.\n",

      "line is: Yasunari Kawabata was born near Osaka in 1899 and was orphaned at the age of two. His first stories were published while he was still in high school and he decided to become a writer. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in 1924 and a year later made his first impact on Japanese letters with 'Izu Dancer'. He soon became a leading figure of the lyrical school that offered the chief challenge to the proletarian literature of the late 1920s. _Snow Country_ (1956) and _Thousand Cranes_ (1959) brought him international recognition and he was the recipient of the 1968 Nobel Prize in Literature. Kawabata died by his own hand on 16 April 1972.\n",
      "line is: Dandelions cover the banks of Ikuta River. They are an expression of the town's character—Ikuta is like springtime, when the dandelions bloom. Three hundred and ninety four of its thirty-five thousand residents are over eighty years old.\n",
      "line is: Only one thing seems out of place in this town: the madhouse. Though maybe it helps for a madhouse to be in such incongruous surroundings. Perhaps whoever chose to put one here, in this quiet, sleepy, graying town, was a sage. Not that every disturbed mind can be cured by peaceful surroundings: the mad inhabit their own worlds, detached from reality, and a simple change of scenery doesn't usually have much of an effect on that. Staying at the clinic, here in Ikuta, probably does less for the patients themselves than the town does for the people who bring them. Madness is more idiosyncratic than sanity; no single cure suits all patients.\n",
      "line is: The families and friends of the mad are blessed, however, by the bright landscape and the welcoming, dandelion-like glow of the town, which blunts their guilt—no, they were not abandoning their loved ones, locking them away in the sort of cruel, desolate environment that comes to mind when one thinks of an insane asylum. As they walk down the path on the riverbank after leaving their lunatic in the clinic on the hill, they hear behind them the long, low gonging of the temple bell. It's as if the one they had left behind is calling to them, saying goodbye. As if the bell is being struck to mark their parting. Forlorn but not unsettled, its ringing passes over the town and heads out to sea. Nothing in the sound suggests that the person striking it is deranged.\n",
      "line is: The doctor mentioned the bell as Kizaki Ineko's mother and Ineko's lover, Kuno, were on their way out, leaving Ineko behind.\n",
      "line is: \"If you hear the bell as you go,\" he said, \"assume it's her ringing it.\"\n",
      "line is: \"We'll have your daughter ring the three o'clock bell today.\"\n",
      "line is: \"One day we let the patients strike the bell, and they all got so excited... Now more of them want to ring it each day than we can possibly manage. Some patients ask us to let them strike it when they've recovered, as a way of marking the end of their stay. And we like to let new patients strike the bell when they join us, unless their symptoms are too severe. Naturally, the nurses stay with them, and not many of our patients are in such dire straits that striking a bell would be too much for them. Your daughter's symptoms for instance are quite mild.\"\n",
      "line is: \"We think there may be something therapeutic in ringing the bell. Of course, we can't be sure—this isn't surgery or internal medicine, after all. Sometimes you think they've gotten better, only to have things take a sudden turn for the worse, and in many cases you can't even identify the cause of their illness. Some of our younger doctors, though, insist they can tell just from the sound of the bell how a patient is doing.\"\n",
      "line is: \"The ringing is definitely telling us something, that's for sure. You hear something coming from deep within them, perhaps—deep in their hearts.\"\n",
      "line is: \"Is that so?\" Kuno nodded, eyeing the doctor a bit skeptically.\n",

Or had it happened more slowly, while she'd made phone call after phone call from her home in Vancouver, British Columbia? There had been so many of those calls, perhaps more than she should have made, but at first she'd needed a friend, and later...later she'd simply needed him.\n",

Twelve years her senior, already very much a man when they met, he must have laughed at the adolescent dramas she'd shared with him, yet he'd always been too kind to let her know.\n",

Her parents were happy that she was staying with their old friends, the Hunts. She was happy as well.

      "line is: Well, 2003 is past—another good year to be reading SF, both in pro and semi-professional publications. And as 2004 began, the President of the United States proposed a broad new initiative in space travel and exploration for the near future. Surely this must bode well for space adventures in fiction, and there is much strength to build on in SF already.\n",
      "line is: The year 2003 was a very strong one for science fiction novels and stories, and there were many shorter stories in consideration. So we repeat, for readers new to this series, our usual disclaimer: This selection of science fiction stories represents the best that was published during the year 2003. It would take several more volumes this size to have nearly all of the best short stories—though, even then, not all the best novellas. And we believe that representing the best from year to year, while it is not physically possible to encompass it all in one even very large book, also implies presenting some substantial variety of excellences, and we left some worthy stories out in order to include others in this limited space.\n",
      "line is: Our general principle for selection: This book is full of science fiction—every story in the book is clearly that and not something else. We have a high regard for horror, fantasy, speculative fiction, and slipstream, and postmodern literature. We (Kathryn Cramer and David G. Hartwell) edit the Year's Best Fantasy in paperback from Eos as a companion volume to this one—look for it if you enjoy short fantasy fiction, too. But here, we choose science fiction.\n",
      "line is: Science fiction in shorter forms was vigorous and perhaps even growing in 2003, though sometimes not in easily accessible places. Certainly, the electronic fiction websites such as Infinite Matrix, Strange Horizons, and SciFiction continued to publish much excellent work, though a majority of it was fantasy or horror. And the professional and semi-professional magazines persisted, though most of them did not thrive in sales or subscriptions, and were a center of interest for SF readers. But the small press really expanded this past year, both in book form and in a proliferation of little magazines, in the U.S. and throughout the world.\n",
      "line is: Books and magazines of high quality from Canada, Australia, and the UK, often anthologies and short story collections, drew our attention. We have to say that this year was perhaps the best in a decade for original anthologies and story collections—even though most of them will not be found in local bookstores because they are available on the whole only by direct mail or internet order, or from specialty dealers at SF conventions. Still, the total of good SF stories, and perhaps even the total of all SF stories, increased noticeably last year.\n",
      "line is: But—and this is a significant but—the majority of small press publications contained only a minority of science fiction genre stories, and the bulk of the rest were speculative literature, fantasy, horror, magical realism, allegories, or uses of SF tropes and images in the context of mainstream or postmodern fiction. This commonly derived from a \"breaking the bounds of genre\" attitude on the part of the editors and publishers of small press short fiction, and many of their writers. Distinguished examples of this trend are Trampoline, Polyphony, Descant, Open Space, and Album Zutique #1 .\n",
      "line is: And somewhat to our amusement, this attitude was contradicted by one of the bastions of mainstream literary fiction, McSweeney's magazine, which published a genre fiction issue, McSweeney's Thrilling Tales, in 2003, edited by Michael Chabon. It was filled mainly with genre stories (SF, horror, fantasy, western, mystery and detective, men's adventure) by literary writers, although certain ambitious genre figures of some acknowledged literary accomplishment, including Harlan Ellison, Michael Moorcock, and Karen Joy Fowler, were included. Each year we find ourselves pointing with some irony at the areas of growth in SF as if they were double-edged swords. While many of the ambitious insiders want to break out, at least some ambitious outsiders are breaking in, and some of them at the top of the genre.\n",
      "line is: The SF magazines struggled to maintain circulation and not allow their subscriber base to erode, while publishing on the whole good-to-excellent stories. Not enough people paid attention, in our opinion. More of you should be reading at least one of the SF magazines regularly, if not two or three. We have remarked in the past that the average paperback anthology of fantasy or SF does not contain as many good stories as the average issue of Asimov's or Fantasy & Science Fiction .\n",
      "line is: Two of the main resources for keeping track of short fiction disappeared for part or all of the year. The ISFDB (the Internet SF Data Base), the largest database of SF story titles on the internet, lost its home and was dormant, though it is back now. And Tangent Online, the most comprehensive review medium for short fiction, fell silent in the second half of the year, although a new editor was announced at the end of 2003. There were regular reviews elsewhere of individual magazines and anthologies, but less than half of the information on current short fiction that has been dependably available for the last six or eight years could be had in 2003. Of course, such information has always depended on volunteer labor, but it does give one pause to think of the fragility of our efforts, and that devoted and hard-working volunteers do sometimes just run out of energy and stop, or seek paying work.\n",
      "line is: We remarked above what a good year it was for anthologies, and some examples are Live without a Net (edited by Lou Anders), Stars (edited by Janis Ian and Mike Resnick), and Space, Inc (edited by Julie Czerneda). Other are mentioned in the various story notes.\n",
      "line is: And from all this we have chosen some fine stories to entertain you. We try in each volume of this series to represent the varieties of tones and voices and attitudes that keep the genre vigorous and responsive to the changing realities out of which it emerges, in science and daily life. This is a book about what's going on now in SF. The stories that follow show, and the story notes point out, the strengths of the evolving genre in the year 2003.\n",

      "line is: Iris stood at the counter in the school office, detention slip in hand, anticipating a hand-smack from Mr. Lucas, the vice principal. She'd already seen him twice since her enrollment at Climping Academy the previous fall. The first time, she'd been turned in for cutting PE. The second time, she'd been reported for smoking outside study hall. She'd been advised there was a smoking area set aside specifically for students, which she argued was on the far side of campus and impossible to get to between classes. That fell on deaf ears. This was now early January and she'd been reported for violating the school's dress code.\n",
      "line is: She was willing to admit that detention slips were a poor means of establishing her place in a new school. The younger students wore uniforms, but in the upper grades, clothing was at the discretion of the individual student as long as the overall look was considered within bounds. The way Iris read it—no skirts or dresses with hemlines above the knee, no tank tops, no shorts, no T-shirts with slogans, no underwear showing, and no flip-flops or Doc Martens. As far as she was concerned, she was playing by the rules. She'd assumed she could wear anything she pleased, within reason, of course. Climp had a different point of view. In the minds of the school administrators, clothing was meant to show modesty, respect, conservatism, and seriousness of purpose.\n",
      "line is: Her choice that morning had been an ankle-length claret-colored velvet dress with a ruffled collar, long sleeves, black tights, and high-top red tennis shoes. Her hair was long and thick, a color that fell somewhere between auburn and flame red thanks to a mixture of boxed dyes. Two big silver barrettes held the mass away from her face. On each wrist she wore a wide leather cuff, studded with brass and silver nail heads. As it turned out, all of this was a great big no-no. Well, shit.\n",
      "line is: The school secretary, Mrs. Malcolm, acknowledged Iris's presence with a nod, but clearly the woman didn't intend to interrupt her work over the antics of a problematic ninth grader. She was busy distributing mail to various teachers' cubbyholes. A student volunteer, Poppy, was stapling together packets of some sort. Iris was a freshman at Climping Academy, the Santa Teresa private school located in Horton Ravine, which was so la-di-da, it totally freaked her out. She was only at Climp because her father had been hired to teach advanced placement math and to coach field hockey. The tuition was twenty thousand dollars a year, which her parents could never have afforded if not for her father's job, which allowed Climp to waive the cost of enrollment.\n",
      "line is: The last high school she'd attended was in a \"mixed\" neighborhood in Detroit, which was to say, drugs, thugs, and vandalism, some of which Iris had generated herself when the mood struck her. She'd been uprooted from Michigan and plunked down on the West Coast despite her protests. California was a bust. She expected surfers, dopers, and free spirits, but it was all the same old shit as far as she could tell. Climping Academy was beyond belief. Enrollment from kindergarten to twelfth grade was three hundred students total, with a pupil-to-teacher ratio of nine to one. Expectations were high and most of the students rose to the occasion. And why would they not? These were all rich kids, whose mommies and daddies gave them the best of everything: trips abroad, unlimited clothing budgets, private tennis and fencing lessons, and weekly visits with a shrink—the latter just in case some boob was gifted with a brand-new VW instead of the BMW he had his heart set on. Big boo-fucking-hoo. Her parents often expressed doubts about her private school attendance, citing the pressure to conform and the dangers of materialism. Her parents fancied themselves Bohemians.\n",
      "line is: One look at her outfit and her homeroom teacher, Mrs. Rubio, had informed her she'd have to go home and change, and when she told Mrs. Rubio she had no transportation, the woman had suggested she take a bus. Like, huh? Iris didn't know anything about bus schedules, so what was she supposed to do? Unlike most of the other students, she didn't live in snooty old Horton Ravine. Moving from Michigan to California had been a shock, the sticker prices for homes being exorbitant. Her parents had purchased a shabby rambling house on the Upper East Side with a mortgage that would keep them enslaved for life. How Bohemian was that? Iris was an only child. Her parents had never wanted children in the first place, a sentiment they were happy to remind her of at the drop of a hat. Her mother, at the age of twenty-five, went in to have her tubes tied against medical advice, and discovered she was pregnant. Husband and wife had agonized over whether to terminate, and in the end they decided it was acceptable to have one child. Often in Iris's hearing, they congratulated themselves on their parenting style, which consisted largely of instilling independence in the girl, meaning an ability to entertain herself and demand precious little.\n",
      "line is: Her mother had a degree in political science and was currently teaching part time at Santa Teresa City College. She also volunteered two afternoons a week at an abortion clinic, where she felt it was incumbent on her to champion reproductive rights, women's control over their own bodies, and the advisability of women keeping their options open instead of burdening themselves with unwanted offspring.\n",
      "line is: Meanwhile, having witnessed the sophistication of Horton Ravine, Iris was embarrassed by the way she was forced to live. On the home front, her parents favored clutter and disarray—imagining perhaps that untidiness and intellectual superiority walked hand in hand. Iris couldn't remember the last time the three of them sat down to a meal. Dishes were left in the sink since neither her mother nor father could be bothered with such things. Dusting and vacuuming were too mundane to address. Laundry went undone. If one of them broke down and actually washed and dried a load, it was left in a pile on the living room sofa to be reclaimed as needed. Iris did her own. Her parents believed it was exploitative of the lower classes to hire household help, so those chores were best left a-begging. They were also committed to the notion of equality between the sexes, which spawned an unspoken competition to see who could force the other to knuckle under and pick up the slack. Iris's bedroom was the only orderly room in the house and she spent most of her free time there isolated from the chaos.\n",

His hair was the color of California beach sand, his face nicely creased. He was tall and trim, given to cashmere vests and dress shirts with the sleeves rolled up. He tossed a file on his desk and took a seat, lacing his fingers above his head. \"Mrs. Rubio has lodged an objection to your outfit,\" he remarked. \"You look like you're on your way to the Renaissance Faire.\"\n",

      "line is: The jam in the corner's from my sandwich. Homemade raspberry. Gran made it. She's been dead seven years, and making that jam was the last thing she did. Sort of. If you ignore the weeks she spent in the hospital attached to one of those heart things that goes _beep beep_ if you're lucky or _beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep_ if you're not. That was the sound echoing around the hospital room seven years ago. _Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep._ My little sister was born six months later, and Dad named her after Gran. Dorothy Constance. When Dad stopped grieving, he decided to shorten it. My sister is small and round so we ended up calling her Dot.\n",
      "line is: My other sister, Soph, is ten. They've both got long blond hair and green eyes and pointy noses, but Soph is tall and thin and darker-skinned, like Dot's been rolled out and crisped in the oven for ten minutes. I'm different. Brown hair. Brown eyes. Medium height. Medium weight. Ordinary, I suppose. To look at me, you'd never guess my secret.\n",
      "line is: I struggled to eat the sandwich in the end. The jam wasn't rotten or anything, because it lasts for years in sterilized jars. At least that's what Dad says when Mum turns up her nose. It's pointy, too. Her hair's the same color as my sisters' but shorter and a bit wavy. Dad's is more like mine, except with gray bits above his ears, and he's got this thing called heterochromia, which means one eye's brown but the other's lighter. Blue if it's bright outside, gray if it's overcast. The sky in a socket, I once said, and Dad got these dimples right in the middle of his cheeks, and I don't know if any of this really matters, but I suppose it's good to give you a picture of my family before I tell you what I came in here to say.\n",

It's bloody freezing and Mum would kill me if she knew I was out of bed, but it's a good place to write this letter, hidden away behind some trees. Don't ask me what type, but they've got big leaves that are rustling in the breeze. _Shhhhwiiishhh._ Actually, that sounds nothing like them.\n",

Lloyd and Webber meowed as if they couldn't quite believe their luck that the sky was raining sandwiches when I chucked it over the hedge. I wasn't hungry anymore. In actual fact I never was, and if I'm being honest, I only made the sandwich in the first place to put off starting this letter. No offense or anything Mr. Harris. It's just difficult. And I'm tired. I haven't really slept since May 1.\n",
      "line is: There's no danger of me dropping off in here. The box of tiles is digging into my thighs, and a draft is blowing through a gap underneath the shed door. I need to get a move on because, just my luck, the flashlight is running out of battery. I tried holding it between my teeth, but my jaw started to ache so now it's balancing near a spiderweb on the windowsill. I don't normally sit in the shed, especially not at 2 AM, but tonight the voice in my head is louder than ever before. The images are more real, and my pulse is racing racing racing, and I bet if my heart was attached to one of those hospital things, all the fast thumping would break it.\n",
      "line is: When I got out of bed, my pajama top was sticking to my back, and my mouth was drier than probably a desert. That's when I put on my bathrobe and tiptoed outside because I knew it was time to write this letter. I can't keep it in anymore. I have to tell someone, and you're the person I chose.\n",
      "line is: I got your contact details off a Death Row website, and I found the website because of a nun, and that's not a sentence I ever thought I'd write, but then my life isn't exactly turning out the way I'd imagined. There was a picture of you looking friendly for someone in an orange jumpsuit with a shaved head, thick glasses, and a scar down one cheek. Yours wasn't the only profile I clicked on. There are hundreds of criminals who want pen pals. Hundreds. But you stood out. All that stuff about your family disowning you so you haven't had any letters for eleven entire years. All that stuff about your guilt.\n",
      "line is: Not that I believe in God, but I went to confession to get rid of my guilt after triple-checking on Wikipedia that the priest wouldn't be able to say anything to the police. But when I sat down in the booth and saw his silhouette through the grille, I couldn't speak. There I was, about to confess to a man who'd never done anything wrong in his life, except for maybe having an extra sip of Communion wine on a bad day. Unless he was one of those priests who abuse children, in which case he would have known all about sin, but I couldn't be sure so I didn't risk it.\n",
      "line is: You're much safer. And you sort of remind me of Harry Potter to be honest. I loved those books when I was little. I can't remember when the first one came out, if it was before or after your murder trial, but anyway in case you're confused Harry Potter has a scar and glasses and you have a scar and glasses, and he never got any mail, either. But then all of a sudden he received a mysterious letter saying he was a wizard and his life was miraculously transformed.\n",

      "line is: It was a good year for genre publishing in general, by which we mean that publishers and authors made money. The year 2010 was also one in which electronic books attained a higher level of sales and became a significant force in bestseller publishing. Not so significant in ordinary publishing. Very significant in academic publishing. At present, the electronic market is driven by the sales of reading devices. Science fiction and fantasy, as we know, is not generally bestseller publishing, and so the genre was not in general hurt but helped in the short run. More or less the same number of printed books were sold in the genre, but the number of ebooks increased, and so a bit more money was made because of ebooks. We spent the last decade saying that we make tens of dollars on ebooks, and when it gets to hundreds, we will know. It got to hundreds in 2010, a big jump.\n",
      "line is: In some areas other than SF, the ebooks appear to have reduced the number of books sold, especially top bestsellers, compromising their profitability. This is bad news for those publishers who went for the \"just publish the bestsellers\" line in the last decade or two. And for the authors. And their agents. And for bookstores that rely on the big bestsellers for a hefty percentage of their sales and profits.\n",
      "line is: Barnes & Noble solved this problem by selling its own ebook reading device. It is too early to tell as we write, but it appears that the real money in ebooks was made from device sales in 2010, not from the content on them. So it remains an ambiguous moment for the book publishing industry, and for authors and editors and readers. And the Google settlement, which will impact the whole situation profoundly, didn't happen in 2010—perhaps in 2011 . . .\n",
      "line is: As we write in February of 2011, the Borders chain, the third largest retailer of books in the U.S., has declared bankruptcy and is closing stores. Bookselling is generally in dire shape, especially mass market bookselling. People are talking in the usual hyperbolic terms about the death of the mass market book. It is certainly true that average mass market sales are in decline, but it is still too early for the funeral.\n",
      "line is: The biggest single chunk of the mass market is women's romance in various forms, and it appears that that audience is avidly adopting ebooks, especially since it is in general an audience that reads daily, and recycles by donation, trading, or simple disposal most of the mass market books. And ebooks are not a clutter problem. The question is, can much of the mass market industry survive the loss of a significant portion of its current print audience? Probably it can. There are still thrillers and mysteries—for the moment. Millions of paperbacks are still being sold.\n",
      "line is: Science fiction magazines once again lost some circulation, and magazines in the mainstream failed in large numbers in 2010. Survivors thus far tend to fulfill specific niches—such as fantasy or science fiction does. Online venues, which might pay contributors but make little money, grew or failed again this year. Non-profit Strange Horizons and Tor.com appeared the most stable of the online bunch. Lightspeed was a new attraction online. Clarkesworld won the Hugo Award for best semiprozine. Lots of the small presses generally carried the ball for innovation in 2010, especially the Bay Area cluster of Night Shade, Tachyon, and Subterranean, and PS Publishing in the UK. There is a whole lot of genre short fiction being published. Steampunk is becoming its own genre, for instance, as alternate history fiction did in the 1990s, only sometimes discernible as science fiction, but there was less genre science fiction in 2010. Analog, for instance, had a stronger-than-average year and no one seemed to notice (we did), so we point it out here. Asimov's featured a lot of talented newcomers in 2010.\n",
      "line is: Science fiction book reviewing seemed in danger of falling completely out of the mainstream in 2010 in the U.S., with not a single major newspaper devoting significant space to it, and fewer-than-ever regional publications covering the new books. Late in the year, Jeff VanderMeer appeared with a review roundup in the New York Times, and then it was announced in January 2011 that Tom Shippey will begin a science fiction and fantasy column in the Wall Street Journal. So there is some hope.\n",
      "line is: Otherwise, the mainstream happily and effectively appropriated tropes and images and settings from SF in a lot of literary and commercial novels, which is in general implying that SF is crap but that we can use pieces of it for real literature. That implication is certainly clear to the publishing establishment, though not, of course, to genre publishing and the genre audience, which generally claims any work that uses the furniture of SF to be really part of the genre, and then claims the writer as an SF writer. Ironically, that strengthens the \"SF is crap\" faction. Watch out for it. The best corrective is intelligent, sympathetic reviewing of genre material by reviewers who can tell the difference between SF and borrowing from SF, and can praise success in either venue appropriately without conflating them. We like some of those mainstream literary successes very much, but they are not successes for the genre, except insofar as letting us know the genre is worth appropriating—which is flattering in its own way.\n",
      "line is: There are still four professional print magazines that publish SF (the Hugo rules say there are three, but this is nonsense—Interzone is a professional magazine), and several online venues that pay more than a token for fiction and are in effect professional markets. However, much of the new fiction of high quality is showcased in original anthologies these days, and they are a significant source for this book (five of the stories this year, actually fewer than in recent years, but the point still holds). Only mentioning the SF anthologies, among the best are: Sprawl, edited by Alisa Krasnostein, an Australian small press collection; Is Anybody Out There, edited by Nick Gevers & Marty Halpern; Metatropolis, edited by John Scalzi (originally an audio book, reprinted in trade in 2010); Shine, edited by Jetse De Vries; and Gateways, edited by Betty Ann Hull. We make a lot of additional comments about the writers and the stories, and what's happening in SF, in the individual introductions accompanying the stories in this book.\n",
      "line is: Our Year's Best SF is an anthology series about what's going on now in SF. We try in each volume to represent the varieties of tones and voices and attitudes that keep the genre vigorous and responsive to the changing realities out of which it emerges, in science and daily life. It is supposed to be fun to read, a special kind of fun you cannot find elsewhere. The stories that follow show, and the story notes point out, the strengths of the evolving genre in the year 2010.\n",
      "line is: This book is full of science fiction—every story in the book is fairly clearly that and not something else. It is our opinion that it is a good thing to have genre boundaries. If we didn't, young writers would probably feel compelled to find something else, perhaps less interesting, to transgress or attack to draw attention to themselves. We have a high regard for horror, fantasy, speculative fiction, and slipstream, and postmodern literature. We (Kathryn Cramer and David G. Hartwell) edit the Year's Best Fantasy as well, a companion volume to this one—look for it if you enjoy short fantasy fiction too. But here, we choose science fiction.

      "line is: Set apart from that discussion is the fact that many Americans don't feel anything at all about their meat. For them, it may as well originate in their local supermarket. It's like flypaper, Frosted Flakes, and fluorescent lighting. It just is.\n",
      "line is: I grew up in Kansas in a family of hunters. Every autumn, my father and brother would take a deer, and it would feed us through the High Plains winter. I never participated in their hunts—just wasn't my thing—but the origin of the contents of our freezer was never in question. Its head was literally on the wall.\n",

That's important.\n",

      "line is: This book is about a man named Yamada no Goji and set during a time in ancient Japan now known as the Heian period. Although the term is derived from the capital city during the era—Heian-kyo (modern Kyoto)—the word heian simply means \"peace and tranquility.\" In comparison to the later feudal era of Japan, when the rise of the samurai class meant every two-bit lording and their armies were at each others' throats, the word is probably appropriate.\n",
      "line is: While the political situation was relatively stable, the spiritual universe of Heian Japan was in the grip of powerful supernatural forces, most of them malicious and all extremely dangerous. That's where Yamada no Goji comes in. A minor aristocrat from a nearly extinct clan, he has no property and no family connections. What he does have is a sharp sword, an even sharper mind, and a willingness—if the price is right—to use both to take on any monster the Heian underworld can throw at him.\n",

That original tone is clearest in the first section, \"Fox Tails.\" But, as characters often do, Yamada had his own ideas about that. Still, that's where it all started, and that's where this book starts. Where it ends . . . well, I hope you'll enjoy finding that out for yourself.\n",

      "line is: While it was still dark, shortly after five o'clock in the morning, a train clanked into the station at Arles and a solitary, exhausted passenger got out. He had been traveling for nearly two days. His journey had begun the previous Sunday in Pont-Aven, near the Atlantic coast of Brittany, almost seven hundred miles away. Since then he had moved by stages from a damp, green region on the Atlantic coast to a flat plain near the point where the Rhône River met the Mediterranean.\n",
      "line is: The route had taken him right across France, via Nantes and Tours, Clermont Ferrand and Lyon. Although he was now in the sunny south, the night air was chilly—only 40°F. He stepped out of the station, turned left and walked under the railway bridge, then along the street until he came to a large open square. On his right was the embankment of a wide river—the Rhône. To the left was the house he was heading for, its shutters still closed. But just at the junction of the street and the square there were signs of animation in an all-night café. He opened the door.\n",
      "line is: It was bright inside because of the lamps hanging from the ceiling. The walls were red, the floorboards bare. Around the sides of the room were tables topped with marble; in the center was a big billiard table; and at the back of the room a small bar covered with assorted bottles. On the wall above, over the entrance to an inner room, hung a handsome clock, still showing not much after five o'clock. The owner looked at the newcomer, then exclaimed, \"You're the pal. I recognize you!\"\n",
      "line is: The speaker, Joseph Ginoux, was proprietor of the café—a new establishment that had opened only at the beginning of the year. He was talking to an artist with some reputation in the circles of the avant-garde. Ginoux had identified him by means that—even in the 1880s—were old-fashioned. Earlier, he had been shown a painted portrait and been told to look out for its subject, who would soon be arriving.\n",
      "line is: Paul Gauguin settled down in the Café de la Gare to wait for dawn. When the sun finally rose, he went out, crossed over to number 2 Place Lamartine, whose yellow walls and green-painted woodwork could now be clearly seen, and knocked on the door. It was opened by Vincent van Gogh.\n",
      "line is: Gauguin's arrival was, it was safe to say, among the most exhilarating but also the most anxious moments of Vincent's life. No sooner had he signed the lease for the Yellow House, almost six months before, than Vincent had started to evolve a plan. He didn't want to live in the house alone; he desperately yearned for company. Right from the start, Gauguin had come to mind as the ideal companion. On that very day he had written to his younger brother, Theo, describing the house and floating a suggestion: \"Perhaps Gauguin would come south?\"\n",
      "line is: The notion rapidly grew into an obsession. From the end of May for the following five months, by letter, Vincent plotted, cajoled, argued, pleaded and insisted that Gauguin journey to Arles and join him. He persuaded Theo—who was already supporting Vincent himself—to offer the penurious painter a deal: free board and lodging in exchange for pictures provided he agreed to live in 2 Place Lamartine, the Yellow House. Theo was working as an art dealer in Paris—one of the few who supported experimental painting—so he was in a position to help Gauguin a great deal.\n",
      "line is: In reply, Gauguin accepted, then—time and again—postponed his departure. A correspondence developed between the two painters, far more intense than their actual, physical acquaintance in Paris the previous winter. Ideas were exchanged and adopted, new paintings described. Vincent was euphoric with the hope that Gauguin would soon appear and cast down by the fear that he would not.\n",
      "line is: Recently—since Gauguin's departure had definitely been announced—Vincent had been consumed by the anxiety that, when the other actually arrived, he would not think much of Arles. Gauguin, Vincent feared, would find the area unsatisfactory in comparison to Brittany. He might find the scenery lacking in the rich possibilities he had discovered in the north. Instead of joining in Vincent's project and offering his companionship, there was the tormenting possibility that Gauguin would be angry and disdainful. Vincent's nervous tension had reached such a point that he feared he would become ill. Some explosion threatened. And now here Gauguin was, actually at the door. He entered.\n",
      "line is: The two men were a little disconcerted by each other. Both had built up their expectations, based on the evidence of recent paintings. In advance of Gauguin's arrival, Vincent had proposed an exchange of portraits. Gauguin had dispatched one south—the picture that had been shown to the café owner, Ginoux—and Vincent had in turn sent a painting of himself north to Brittany. But those self-portraits were not simply evidence of how the two men actually looked or who they actually were. One was a forty-year-old Frenchman with an estranged family and a background in financial trading, the other a thirty-five-year-old Dutchman who had tried his hand at various tasks. Both had come to painting relatively late in life. But the pictures were indices of how Gauguin and Van Gogh imagined themselves. Each had presented his image in character, as a figure from literature. One thing they had in common was an intense fantasy life in which their own real lives merged with their reading.\n",
      "line is: In the corner of his picture, Gauguin had painted above his signature the words \" _Les Misérables_ \"—a reference to the best-known of all French novels, Victor Hugo's masterpiece. This was an easy clue, as such things go. Gauguin meant to present himself as an artistic equivalent to the hero of that novel, Jean Valjean—convicted criminal, outcast, martyr and saint.

      "line is: Jonah was dead for a brief time before the paramedics brought him back to life. He never talks about it, but it's on his mind sometimes, and he finds himself thinking that maybe it's the central fact of the rest of his life, maybe it's what set his future into motion. He thinks of the fat cuckoo clock in his grandfather's living room, the hollow thump of weights and the dissonant guitar thrum of springs as the little door opened and the bird popped out; he thinks of his own heart, which was stopped when they got to him and then suddenly lurched forward, no one knew why, it just started again right around the time they were preparing to pronounce him deceased.\n",
      "line is: This was in late March 1977, in South Dakota, a few days after his sixth birthday.\n",
      "line is: If his memory were a movie, the camera would begin high in the air. In a movie, he thinks, you would see his grandfather's little house from above, you would see the yellow school bus coming to a stop at the edge of the long gravel road. Jonah had been to school that day. He had learned something, perhaps several things, and he rode home in a school bus. There were papers in his canvas knapsack, handwriting and addition and subtraction tables that the teacher had graded neatly with red ink, and a picture of an Easter egg that he'd colored for his mother. He sat on a green vinyl seat near the front of the bus and didn't even notice that the bus had stopped because he was deeply interested in a hole that someone had cut in the seat with a pocketknife; he was peering into it, into the guts of the seat, which were made of metal springs and stiff white hay.\n",
      "line is: Outside it was fairly sunny, and the snow had mostly melted. The exhaust from the bus's muffler drifted through the flashing warning lights, and the silent bus driver lady caused the doors to fold open for him. He didn't like the other children on the bus, and he felt that they didn't like him either. He could sense their faces, staring, as he went down the bus steps and stood on the soft, muddy berm.\n",
      "line is: But in the movie you wouldn't see that. In the movie you would only see him emerging from the bus, a boy running with his backpack dragging through the wet gravel, a red stocking cap, a worn blue ski jacket, stones grinding together beneath his boots, a pleasantly rhythmic noise he was making. And you would be up above everything like a bird, the long gravel road that led from the mailbox to the house, the weeds along the ditches, the telephone poles, barbed-wire fences, railroad tracks. The horizon, the wide plain of dust and wind.\n",
      "line is: Jonah's grandfather's house was a few miles outside of the small town of Little Bow, where Jonah went to school. It was a narrow, mustard-colored farmhouse with a cottonwood beside it and a spindly chokecherry bush in front. These were the only trees in view, and his grandfather's place was the only house. From time to time a train would pass by on the railroad tracks that ran parallel to the house. Then the windows would hum like the tuning fork their teacher had shown them in school. _This is how sound feels,_ their teacher said, and let them hold their fingers near the vibrating tines.\n",
      "line is: Sometimes it seemed to Jonah that everything was very small. In the center of his grandfather's bare backyard, an empty pint of cream would be the house and a line of matchbook cars, Scotch-taped end to end, would be the train. He didn't know why he liked the game so much, but he remembered playing it over and over, imagining himself and his mother and his grandfather and his grandfather's dog, Elizabeth, all of them inside the little pint container, and himself (another part of himself) leaning over them like a giant or a thundercloud, pushing his makeshift train slowly past.\n",
      "line is: He didn't call to his grandfather when he came into the house that day. The door banged shut, the furniture sat silently. He could hear the television talking in his grandfather's room, so he knew his grandfather was there, dozing in the little windowless room, an addition to the house, just space enough for his grandfather's bed and a dresser, a small TV and a lamp with curlicues of cigarette smoke around them. His grandfather was propped up against some pillows, drinking beer; an old blanket, pilled cotton, silk edges unraveling, was thrown across his grandfather's middle, an ashtray balanced on it. Tired. His grandfather worked as a janitor, he went to work early in the morning, while it was still dark. Sometimes when Jonah came home from school, his grandfather would come out of his room and tell Jonah stories or jokes, or he would complain about things, about being tired, about Jonah's mother— _What's the problem with her now? Did you do something to get her mad? I didn't do anything to her!_ —and he would swear about people that he didn't like, people who had cheated him, or maybe he would smile and call Elizabeth to him, _Babygirl, babygirl, what are you doing there, does a babygirl want a piece of lunch meat does she?_ and Elizabeth would come clicking her nails across the floor, her bobbed tail almost vibrating as she wagged it, her eyes full of love as Jonah's grandfather crooned to her.\n",
      "line is: But Jonah's grandfather didn't come out of his room that day, and Jonah dropped his bookbag to the floor of the kitchen. There was the smell of smoke, and fried eggs, and the old food in the refrigerator. Unwashed dishes in the sink. His grandfather's door was half-closed, and Jonah sat at the kitchen table for a time, eating cereal.\n",
      "line is: His mother was at work. He didn't know whether he missed her or not, but he thought of her as he sat there in the still kitchen. She worked at a place called Harmony Farm, _packing eggs,_ she said, and the tone of her voice made him imagine dark labyrinths with rows of nests, a promenade of sad, dirty workers moving slowly through the passageways.\n",
      "line is: She wouldn't talk about it when she got home. Often, she wouldn't want to talk at all, wouldn't want to be touched, would make their supper, which she herself wouldn't eat. She would go to her room and listen to old records she'd had since she was in junior high, her eyes open and her hands in a praying shape beneath her cheek, her long hair spread out behind her on the pillow.\n",

      "line is: It's early 2007 and I'm standing on a ship off the coast of northeastern Australia. We're moored right by Lizard Island, named by my fellow Londoner and Great Briton Captain Cook, and I'm making this film called _Fool's Gold_ starring Matthew McConaughey, Kate Hudson and my old mate Donald Sutherland, who is a blinding geezer.\n",
      "line is: Donald is playing an Englishman and I'm playing a Yank, but in hindsight we should've swapped roles because I was fucking diabolical in that film – I should've got nicked for impersonating an actor. Anyway, I digress . . . a big word for me – seven letters.\n",
      "line is: So there's a bit of a buzz going on with a few people running about on deck, and all of a sudden we're summoned downstairs to this big room with a telly in it. This is the whole fucking crew by the way, with me and Donald hiding at the back like two naughty schoolboys. Then somebody announces it's the 'Most Beautiful Man in the World' Awards.\n",
      "line is: Well, obviously me and the Don think we might be in the running here, but hold up, the next announcement tells us that our very own Matthew McConaughey is one of the nominees and he's up against that other alright-looking geezer, George Clooney. Anyway, the show begins and Matthew is giving it the old 'Woo! Woo!' like the Yanks do when they get excited. After about five minutes of this bollocks I wanna be somewhere else – anywhere else. Yeah, I suppose I might be a little bit jealous. I mean, he ain't a bad-looking fella . . .\n",
      "line is: As they're building up to the big moment the television shows this satellite going across the world from east to west. Funny how everything and everyone seems to travel from east to west. Maybe they're following the sun – wanting to find out where it goes before it comes up the other side again – or maybe they thought it went down a hole. Anyway, this satellite is travelling across Europe and as it's getting closer to London, I'm thinking, 'You never know . . .'\n",
      "line is: Bang! It hits London and with all the lapping up that's going on I can't contain myself any more. I shout out, 'Stop right there, my son! That's me!' The Aussies, who have a great sense of humour – well, they're cockney Irish, ain't they? Or at least the majority are – are all giggling. But as far as the others are concerned, it goes straight over their heads.\n",
      "line is: Eventually the satellite gets to America and we're into Clooney and McConaughey territory. We creep quietly past George and slip loudly into Texas, and at this point it's announced that Matthew is the winner. He goes absolutely potty – like he's scored the winning goal in the World Cup final and won the Heavyweight Championship of the World in one go.\n",
      "line is: The whole thing just seems a bit embarrassing, but then on reflection I start to think maybe this is the big difference between us – apart from my good looks, of course. Maybe this is what makes Matthew a film star, which he is – at the time of writing he's just won an Oscar, and deservedly so.\n",
      "line is: Anyway, once I finally get back up on deck, the whole thing kinda makes me think about where I've come from. Looking at Australia, 14,000 miles away from home – literally on the other side of the world – I start thinking about me and my mate Tony Yeates as kids in the East End, and I start thinking about Captain Cook. There's a plaque on the Mile End Road which marks the start of his journey to Oz. It's just opposite the place a club called Nashville's used to be, where me and Tony had a few adventures of our own in the late seventies. We'd often find ourselves gazing unsteadily up at that plaque after we'd had a few on a Friday night – dreaming of travelling the world, the places we might see and the people we might meet. And suddenly standing on that ship in the southern hemisphere, it comes to me: 'I've made that journey. I've done what Cook did!'\n",
      "line is: Alright, he did it on a sailing ship and I did it First Class British Airways, but I've done it just the same. I'm not trying to book myself as being on Cook's level as an explorer, but for someone who comes from where I do, getting to the Great Barrier Reef was still some kind of achievement. That was when the idea of paying my own tribute to the places and the people that made me what I am (I won't be demanding actual blue plaques: 'Ray Winstone narrowly escaped a good kicking here' etc.) started to make me smile. I hope it will do the same for you.\n",
      "line is: When I look back through the history of my family, we've done fuck all for this country. I don't mean that in a bad way. The Winstones weren't villains. We've always been grafters, back and forthing between the workhouse and the public house. But at the time I was born – in Hackney Hospital on 19 February 1957 – the Second World War was still very much on people's minds. It's probably a bit of a cliché to say 'everyone had lost somebody', but in our family, it wasn't even true. Maybe it was more the luck of the draw in terms of their ages than anything else, but there was no one you could put your finger on and say they had sacrificed themselves in any way.\n",

      "line is: 'I DO HOPE THAT YOU & Papa are as delighted as we are to have a granddaughter, or would you sooner have another grandson?' Prince Albert, Duke of York, wrote to his mother, Queen Mary. 'I know Elizabeth wanted a daughter.' His wife, the Duchess of York, had given birth by Caesarean section to their first child at 2.40 a.m. on the morning of 21 April 1926. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary of York was a plump infant princess, a blessing on a happy marriage and, although officially third in line to the throne, seen as little more.\n",
      "line is: Crowds were cheering outside the house, but for others the monarchy was a hated symbol of privilege and repression, tottering at the top of an unfair system. Britain in 1926 was seized by worker unrest. In the previous spring, mine owners had informed their employees that wages would be lowered and hours increased. The union threatened industrial action. Stanley Baldwin's Conservative government authorised a royal commission into the matter and it found for the mine owners. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) declared a general strike for 3 May, calling out other workers including railwaymen, printers and dockers. It was a stand-off and they were determined to win.\n",
      "line is: In such turmoil, the advancing pregnancy of the twenty-five-year-old wife of the second son and third child of King George V, Albert, Duke of York, was an unwelcome distraction for the Home Secretary, Sir William Joynson-Hicks. Called early on 21 April, not long before he was due to attend a vital meeting between the Prime Minister and the coal owners, he hurried to the home of the Duchess's parents, 17 Bruton Street in Mayfair. There, Elizabeth Alexandra Mary was born; he assented to her legitimacy and dashed back to his papers.\n",
      "line is: The King and Queen arrived to visit their first granddaughter (the Princess Royal already had two sons). Queen Mary declared that the child was a 'little darling with a lovely complexion and pretty hair'. The Duke and Duchess were equally happy. 'We have long wanted a child to make our happiness complete,' the Duke wrote. They had waited three years – long by the standards of the time.\n",
      "line is: 'We are so anxious for her first name to be Elizabeth as it is such a nice name & there has been no one of that name in your family for a long time,' the Duke wrote to his father. Victoria was summarily discounted. 'He says nothing about Victoria. I hardly think that necessary,' George V said of his son to Queen Mary. The name 'Elizabeth' was chosen because it was her mother's, not to recall Elizabeth I. The Princess took her names from her mother, her great-grandmother and her grandmother and, indeed, her initials were identical to those of her mother: E.A.M. She was named after consorts and wives, not ruling queens. Her destiny was to make a good marriage, possibly into a foreign royal family, and become a supportive wife and mother, just like her mother, the Duchess of York, her grandmother, Queen Mary, and her great-grandmother, Queen Alexandra. The heir to the throne would be the child of her as yet unmarried uncle, Edward, Prince of Wales – 'David' to his family.\n",
      "line is: 'The House of Hanover, like ducks, produce bad parents,' said the Royal Librarian to Sir Harold Nicolson, biographer of George V, 'they trample on their young.' George I, the Princess's great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, had arrived to rule in 1714 and began the Hanoverian line. He had made scant effort to speak English and his son, George II, had been reclusive. Despite losing the American colonies, George III had been a widely popular king both for his engagement with the country and his lengthy marriage to Queen Charlotte, and his sufferings from porphyria only increased sympathy for him. His seven sons and six daughters did not follow his uxorious example and before the arrival of Princess Charlotte, daughter of the Prince of Wales, in 1796, they had managed to produce between them over fifty-six illegitimate children – and no legitimate heir.\n",
      "line is: George IV separated from his wife, Princess Caroline, after three days and returned to his Mrs Fitzherbert, the Catholic widow he had married in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act in 1772. William IV had ten children with the celebrated actress, Mrs Jordan, and none with his wife. The reputation of the royal family was low when George IV's niece, Victoria, daughter of Edward, Duke of Kent, succeeded to the throne at just eighteen in 1837. The tiny Queen began summarily to rescue the monarchy's reputation, assiduously engaging with the duties of court and politics, and carefully showing herself off to the public as dignified and hard-working – the polar opposite of her misbehaving uncles. With her husband, Albert of Saxe-Coburg, she instigated the notion of the virtuous royal family, and prints and portraits disseminated images of the monarch and her brood around her great Empire. By the end of her reign Victoria's position was unassailable and her disreputable predecessors were a colourful memory. She ruled a quarter of the world's population, her nine children were married into European royalty and the British aristocracy, and her grandson by her eldest child, Victoria, Princess Royal, was the German Kaiser Wilhelm II.\n",
      "line is: Victoria's son, Bertie, later King Edward VII, rebelled against his mother's iron morals as a young man – but he deplored the same lassitude when it manifested itself in his own eldest son, Prince Eddy, Duke of Clarence. The young Prince could not settle to life in the navy and muddled his way into the seedy corners of London's underworld. His father consulted Queen Victoria on the matter. 'A good sensible wife – with considerable character – is what he needs,' he wrote. 'But where is she to be found?'\n",
      "line is: The ever-resourceful Queen had her eye on the young Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, always known as May, the twenty-two-year-old daughter of her cousin, Princess Mary Adelaide, whose father had been younger brother to the Duke of Kent. The family were lacking in funds and dignity, and really hardly royal, for May's father was the product of the morganatic marriage of Duke Alexander of Württemberg. Shy Princess May had spent her teenage years in an agony of embarrassment as fellow royals looked down on her family, and her gigantically fat mother sallied forth, pretending not to care. Queen Victoria was more interested in May's restrained character than her lack of funds (and, indeed, the latter was perhaps desirable, for it made the family very unlikely to interfere). For her, the twenty-two-year-old Princess was a 'superior girl', steady, sensible and lacking in frivolity. May and Eddy were quickly betrothed, her trousseau was ordered and then, in January 1892, 5 weeks before the wedding, Eddy died of influenza. May's bridal wreath was laid on his coffin. 'The dear girl looks like a crushed flower,' Victoria wrote.\n",
      "line is: Princess May was the object of great public pity (and her hopelessly indebted family were in a state of terror over the expensive trousseau they had ordered). Stranded, with no other suitors, it seemed to many that her marriage prospects were ruined. But the plump and resolute Victoria was not about to let May slip through her fingers. The Queen decided she should marry the new heir, Eddy's brother, twenty-six-year-old Prince George. Princess May herself was distressed by the idea and decided to leave England. The Prince of Wales and George later visited her and her family at Cannes – and the two young people began to forge a genuine friendship.\n",
      "line is: Prince George was simple, disciplined, fond of the navy and very conscious of his duty. Four months after Eddy's death, George proposed to May and the wedding took place the following July. 'Princess May is the ideal bride,' declared the _Lady's Magazine._ 'I am simply devoted to you,' George wrote to his wife a few months into their marriage. In 1910 her husband ascended to the throne and the young girl from a rackety family became Queen Mary, famously dignified, calm and severe, as impressively regal as Queen Victoria had been. The role took its toll, however. At the height of the Second World War she stayed with friends in Gloucestershire and wept when she was told she could return to London. 'I shall have to begin being Queen Mary all over again,' she said.\n",
