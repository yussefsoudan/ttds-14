This was an ugly automobile. It had a sun visor over the front windshield, so it looked like the car was wearing a fedora. Sometimes it looked like the car was an old-time film noir detective sitting in front of our house. It wasn't a family car. This was a getaway car. They killed Sonny on the Causeway in this car.

quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b1","quote":"The twisted piece of metal sat in front of our house, at 549 East Park in Long Beach, Long Island. A sleepy beach town of approximately ten thousand people, which nodded off in the winter and woke up in July to three times as many enjoying a beautiful summer at the sea, Long Beach was surrounded by water. The bay (Reynold's Channel) on one side of town, with its beautiful wetlands; and the Atlantic Ocean on the other, its thunderous waves hitting the shore of beautiful white sand beaches. The boardwalk stretched the length of the town and featured some amusement park rides. There were games of chance, and a batting cage, a soft ice cream shop, a knish place (Izzy's) and a large municipal swimming pool. Modest homes, and the occasional thirties mansion, dotted the tree-lined streets. A few hotels near the boardwalk were once filled with people, making Long Beach at one time a sort of Atlantic City without the saltwater taffy and the diving horse. The abandoned submarine watch tower, left standing since World War II, was the place to take your girl for a kiss, or smoke a cigarette for the first time. At one time there was horseback riding on the beach, and supposedly George M. Cohan wrote \"Only 45 Minutes from Broadway\" about Long Beach.","_id":"q18"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b1","quote":"It was known as America's healthiest city, which is why my sickly grandparents moved there from the Bronx and bought homes for my Uncle Danny and us, in 1951.

quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b1","quote":"Two weeks later, the car came back. Well, Big John knew a lot about bodywork because the car looked great, and after we opened the trunk to make sure there were no bodies in it, we took it out for a ride. And everything was great until Dad tried to make a right turn. Almost impossible. The car barely reacted to Dad's turning of the steering wheel. It moaned and groaned; so did Dad. The car just couldn't make right turns very well. They couldn't fix that. You actually had to make three left turns in order to make one right turn. But it didn't matter; we had our new car.","_id":"q40"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b1","quote":"They put me up front, in the middle, with my brothers in the back. I sat up front because I was the one who didn't need legroom; and I still don't. I always sat in between my mom and my dad because my mom never drove the car when Dad was around . . . never. Dad was very much a man of the times. He was the hunter, gatherer, driver . . . er . . . But when we were sitting like this, she would always take her left arm and put it behind my head and let it rest lightly on the right shoulder of the man that she loved so much. And I would sit in the middle, and I would look at him, my first hero, as he drove that car, his left arm outside the window getting that little yarmulke tan around his elbow, and smoking his cigarette—because they told us in the fifties, \"Cigarettes taste good and are so good for you.\" And he looked like he was driving a Rolls-Royce or a Bentley, never for once thinking he was driving a gray-on-gray Plymouth Belvedere that couldn't make right turns. That was my dad.","_id":"q41"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b1","quote":"He worked so hard for us all the time. He held down two jobs, including weekend nights. The only day we really had alone with him was Sunday. Sunday was our day for my two brothers and I to put on a show and make them laugh. Sunday was our day to go up on the boardwalk in Long Beach and play Skeeball or Fascination, go to the batting cage, play baseball, go bowling, or to the movies, even a Broadway show. Sunday night was our night to go out to eat together. We'd always go out for Italian food, or Chinese food, because on Sunday nights, Jews are not allowed to eat their own food. That's in the Talmud.","_id":"q42"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b1","quote":"\"On the seventh day, God rested and then went to Twin Dragons for dinner, because He loved the ribs.\" If you go to any Italian restaurant on a Sunday, there are only Jewish families. If you go to a Chinese restaurant, there are only Jewish families. Have you ever seen a Chinese family at a deli on a Sunday having a big plate of pickled herring, and chopped liver? It doesn't happen.","_id":"q43"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b1","quote":"And Dad would come in like three, four o'clock on a Sunday morning after working all weekend. Just as the sun came up, I would tiptoe over to their bedroom, which was right next to my room in the back, and I would quietly open the door just a little, and there they would be, Mom and Dad, lying there, looking so quiet, and so peaceful together. And I would sit in the doorway waiting for him to wake up, just to see what we were going to do together that day. I just couldn't wait for Sundays. I couldn't wait for Sundays. He died suddenly when I was fifteen. I once calculated that I had roughly 700 Sundays. That's it. 700 Sundays. Not alot of time for a kid to have with his dad.","_id":"q44"}

quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b1","quote":"The Crystal side was small. It was Dad, his brother, Berns, and their sister, Marcia. There weren't that many cousins in his extended family. His mom, Sophie, was a sweet Russian woman. We actually look a great deal alike. She had left Kiev when she was just fifteen. Told her parents she was going to take a walk, and made her way to America.","_id":"q59"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b1","quote":"My Aunt Marcia was one of my favorites, a beautiful red-haired blue-eyed woman, with a great sense of humor. I always felt extremely close to her. Uncle Berns was the baby, all six foot four and 250 pounds of him. He was a true eccentric, bigger than life. He had the mime ability of a circus clown, and he could do magic tricks, and would always use one of us as his assistant. He seemed more like our older brother. He was the uncle you could play with. He was an artist, who had actually been ordered by Eisenhower during World War II to interpret the war on canvas. His first assignment was D-Day. His life story would later become a documentary film directed by my daughter Lindsay, for HBO.","_id":"q60"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b1","quote":"The Gabler side was Mom's family. She was one of six brothers and sisters. The generation before them was a mixture of the Kasindorfs, from Rostov on the Don in Russia, and the Gablers of Vienna.","_id":"q61"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b1","quote":"My Grandma Susie (Kasindorf) was one of nine children. Grandpa Julius (Gabler) was one of four brothers, and all of these people had a lot of kids; they really took the \"Be fruitful and multiply\" quote from the Bible very seriously. So when we all got together for a holiday dinner, it was an enormous crowd of colorful characters. There was my Aunt Lee, who was one of the first woman bank presidents in America; her brother, my Uncle Sid Kasindorf, who was an inventor. He actually built one of the first transistor radios; he put it in a box of wooden stick matches, and it was featured at the World's Fair of l939. My Aunt Jean (Mom's sister) and Uncle Greenie were husband-and-wife doctors. Greenie wrote the first papers on ambulating patients after surgery. There were furriers and architects, accountants, a baby bonnet salesman, even a suspected spy.","_id":"q62"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b1","quote":"The rest of the family was not quite as exotic. Hardworking people. The kind of people who spoke mostly Yiddish, which is a combination of German and phlegm. This is a language of coughing and spitting; until I was eleven, I wore a raincoat.

quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b1","quote":"The word gets out to all the jazz artists around the country, that there's this young producer who has a great set of ears and an even bigger heart. Now everybody wants to do a session with my Uncle Milt on what is now our family business, the Commodore jazz label. Milt was a natural producer. He was a charismatic man, with a great laugh, and booming voice. He also was a great judge of character. He understood the musicians. He spent so much time getting to know them, he realized that he didn't have to get too creative with their talents. Make them comfortable, he thought, and make it sound like they were on stage \"jammin'.\" He placed the microphones in the studio, so they would play together not separately, as was the norm, and he would simply bring a couple of bottles of whiskey, a carton of cigarettes, and turn them loose. He let them play it the way they felt it. He let them play it the way they created it. Sometimes, on one Commodore record, there would be three cuts of the very same song. He would press all three cuts because there was a better solo, the beat was different, or there was just something about it that the musicians liked. He put them all on the same record, and they were grateful to him for it. He said, \"Listen. Who am I to tell them how to play this? After all, this is jazz, America's only true art form.\"","_id":"q85"}

Dad had a special feeling for him, and so he started producing concerts at a place called the Lighthouse for the Blind in New York City, a wonderful center for sightless people. It was one of his favorite places to put on shows. I once asked him, \"Why do you like it there so much, they can't see?\" He said, \"Yeah, but they hear better than anybody.\"","_id":"q95"}

I used to love to answer the phone, not only because I thought someday somebody would call telling me they were going to take me to Hollywood, but I loved talking to the musicians. One of my favorites was Willie \"The Lion\" Smith. Willie was a very rare and charming man. He was a black Jewish man, who had also been a cantor in a synagogue at one time. He would call, and if I answered he would speak fluent Yiddish to me. I didn't know any Yiddish, but I would nod, and say \"Hmm\" once in a while, just so Willie would think I was following the conversation. I'd say, \"Do you want to talk to my dad?\" Willie would say, \"Vat Den Bubbeleh, I like talking vit you, but you don't have any pockets.\" (Meaning Dad was the one who could pay him.)","_id":"q97"}

The players loved Dad because he would do this, and he loved them back. When he played them, he paid them the best he could, and when they died, he ran benefits for their families. They really were his other set of sons, and my brothers and I understood it, because we loved them too. If Dad made a buck, he gave them eighty-five cents.

It was a grassy island in the middle of Park Avenue, about seventy-five yards long, with some trees on it, traffic moving in both directions on either side of it. But to us, it was our stadium. We would always be out there, playing ball. Traffic would slow down to watch us. We'd practice double plays, play \"running catch,\" which meant you had to throw it over someone's head so they would have to make a difficult play. Sometimes drivers would honk their horns in appreciation. We would fungo hard grounders at each other, and if you could field a grounder on that mall, you could field anywhere. We always played with a baseball. There was no organized Little League in Long Beach, and the schoolyard games were always on concrete, played with a softball. That's why those Sunday batting sessions with Dad were so important, because we were playing good old-fashioned hard ball.","_id":"q170"}

I'd catch it, and I'd throw to either side, harder and harder so my reflexes got to be really fast. Then I would move closer. It was like pulling a bullet out of the air. I could catch anything, and I learned not to be afraid of the ball.

Eventually, like a good impersonation, you put yourself into it so it becomes a blend of the best of you and the best of the person you're imitating.

I would go on to play and become the captain of our high school team. I also played basketball and soccer for Long Beach High, but baseball was really my sport. All those years playing with Joel and Rip were some of our best times. We weren't competing for laughs or attention, or having our occasional fights. Baseball was the great equalizer.

He'd sit in a chair, in one corner of the living room, and Rip and I would take turns hitting the ball at him, as if we were hockey players, and Joel was the goalie. You would get ten shots \"on goal,\" and then we would rotate. The one who saved the most shots was the winner. Our hallway became a bowling alley, complete with minature pins. He made a small basketball hoop, like those Nerf ones that are so popular now, which we would hook over his bedroom door, and with a tennis ball, his room became Madison Square Garden.

Berns was making people forget just for a few moments why they were there, and it was okay. He had just lost his brother, the person he was closest to in the world.

Sometimes two of them would be in the room, but never more, and they never used physical force, even with the worst criminals. He had heard of that rule being broken only once. Guy Georges, the infamous Beast of the Bastille serial killer, was hit when he was arrested in 1998, after he had raped and killed at least seven women. No handcuffs were used at the headquarters either, a policy widely criticized after a suspect committed suicide.

Paul had left home around eight-thirty and had gone directly to his office. Witnesses confirmed that he was at his desk at nine. He needed thirty minutes to get to work by car. Commander Kriven checked it personally, with a stopwatch in hand. Around ten, Miss Jory went out to buy a paper and some bread. She had made the usual small talk with the shop owners. One of her neighbors, an elderly lady, crossed paths with her a little later, as she was re-entering the building. It was impossible to find out anything from that moment on. Had she met someone in the stairwell? Had she opened the door for a visitor? There were still unanswered questions. In any case, nobody had forced the door. A team of investigators continued to question the neighbors. Perhaps someone had seen her through a window.

Here, he was in the very heart of the capital, and yet there was no noise. He would never have had the means to pay for this without the money his father had left him. Thanks to a combination of hard work, intuition, and a bit of luck, his family had made a fortune in trading, and Nico had often lent a hand.

What was going on in the mind of a man who could do this kind of thing? There was perversity in how he tortured the woman, and the violence supplanted the meticulous organization.

The apartment was clean, orderly, and tastefully decorated. That shows a structured personality. Either she knew the killer, or he inspired such trust that she invited him into her home, in which case we are dealing with a manipulator. I see him as a sadistic psychopath who prepares his crime methodically. He chose his victim for her specific profile and left nothing to chance. He undoubtedly feels no remorse. He is intelligent and has a comfortable life. He is a man who gives the impression of being perfectly normal. I have not yet used the term serial killer, but there is evidence he leans in that direction. It's indicated by his use of a whip, which could characterize a fetish, and the mutilation of the victim's breasts. Both are elements that could be linked to the subject's relationship with his mother, just like the stab wound in the abdomen. These could be explained by some heart-felt childhood humiliation.\"","_id":"q721"}

He picked up the box on the corner of his desk and left the division offices. On the way, a travel agency caught his attention. Its name, written in white letters, stood out on a background the color of the South Seas, giving him a sudden desire to get away. To fly to the other side of the world, to forget his duties, to lie on white sand beaches and swim in warm, clear waters, to take the time to live—what a fine dream to share with a woman. Dr. Dalry came to mind. Clearly, he couldn't stop thinking about her. Perhaps he was just affection-deprived.","_id":"q726"}

He was wearing the same reassuring smile as he moved toward her. Her pupils dilated slightly, a simple cerebral motor reflex. He smelled her sophisticated perfume. Her perfect body left him cold.

Her eyes filled with terror. She tried kicking. She wanted to scream, but it was too late. Her eyelids closed under the effect of the drug, and she stopped moving. Now his prey was asleep. Calmly, he removed the equipment he needed from his backpack. He exchanged his leather gloves for latex. He locked the entrance door and took an instant to explore the apartment. The living room was perfect. He carried the inanimate body there, took off all of her clothes, and bound her wrists to the heavy table in the adjoining dining room. She was nude, lying on her back, with her arms raised. He grabbed duct tape from his bag and gagged her. The effect of the anesthesia would wear off soon, but she wouldn't be able to scream. Then he sat down next to his prey and waited for her to wake up. He stared at her with a relentless, empty look. He would do nothing to her until she regained consciousness. He wanted to see the panic deep in her eyes; he wanted to hear the moans of pain. He would act slowly, getting the most from every second. He would whip her skin into strips. Most important, he would cut off those round breasts that she was so proud of. And he had a little surprise for her.","_id":"q733"}

She typed in the code and took the elevator to the fourth floor. She rushed to knock on the door. Nobody answered. What should she do? She would contact Greg. A secretary answered. Greg couldn't be reached at the moment. She nearly screamed that it was an emergency, scaring the secretary. A silence. Then Greg's tense voice. \"Anne? What's going on?\"","_id":"q773"}

The police established offices on the Quai des Orfèvres in 1792, during the Paris Commune. Number 36 came about later, in 1891, when the Brigade de Sûreté occupied the third floor. From the time of Eugène François Vidocq, named the first crime-detection chief in 1811, to the Brigades du Tigre a century later, history was peppered with famous criminal cases, extraordinary investigations, and emblematic figures—both criminal and cop. The address symbolized the epic story of the hard-working and smart people who dedicated their lives to solving crimes. Nico was keenly aware of his professional heritage. He felt a profound sense of responsibility to his predecessors. Whenever he left 36 Quai des Orfèvres, he saluted the bronze bust of Alphonse Bertillon, the father of anthropometry and mug shots, who served as head of the Criminal Identity Division at the end of the nineteenth century.","_id":"q899"}

She had been perfectly trained for the job, which involved participating in murder investigations and tracking psychopaths of all kinds. She remembered her first dead body. She couldn't eat meat for three days. She had gotten past that stage. She was hardened and had learned to create space between her private life and her job, to the point of never talking about her police work with her loved ones.

Paul Terrade was the father of Marie-Hélène Jory's child, according to the paternity test. Human cells had forty-six chromosomes arranged in pairs, and each pair contained strands of DNA. A child would get twenty-three chromosomes from each parent, and this made it possible to prove paternity. But the result of the DNA test was not surprising.

He was going to find himself face-to-face with his victim, despite the activity in the neighborhood. He could take his time, and nobody would be worried. A shiver of pleasure ran up his spine at the thought of what was to come. Then he felt the unsparing, glacial hatred rising from deep inside his soul. He imagined the expression of terror, the suffering, the mutilation, and then the death that would come as deliverance. In the end, there would be the staging of the scene in the strange silence that followed the torment and the satisfaction of accomplishing a job with self-control and precision.

His leg brushed against hers, and she didn't move away. His heart was beating fast. Tanya kept smiling at him, a sign that she had intuited his feelings.

He concluded that Alexis Perrin could not be the author of the messages—which didn't mean that he wasn't the murderer.

After six hours, the corneas became covered with an opalescent veil, making it tricky to discern the patient's actual eye color. Body temperature was also an indicator of time of death.

As he began the interview, Trajan stared at the white wall in front of him. He answered by shaking his head mechanically, and he had nothing to say. He didn't understand why his wife had been chosen.

She was all his. He could do whatever he wanted with her. He would whip her. Thirty lashes that would leave their mark on her skin forever. Thirty lashes to celebrate the only anniversary he remembered. To get revenge, to make up for a lack of love, for wandering and for remorse. And who worried about his pain? Who had extended a hand to him? Who had held him? Nobody. The time for revenge was now.","_id":"q1241"}

Yet frustration and a sense of being ineffective were crowding his mind. Now he was imagining the killer's fourth victim. The usual time for the crime had come and gone; it was on everyone's mind, even though no one had said anything. Another woman might already be dead. He called Caroline. He couldn't leave headquarters, and he shyly suggested that she join him at his office. He was afraid she wouldn't like that; in any case, she seemed to understand the situation and accepted. She arrived a little later with a bag of sandwiches and soft drinks. But he was hungry for her. He pushed her up against the wall in his office and kissed her fiercely. He had to caress her skin. He slipped his hands under her shirt and ran them along her back. She was soft and warm. She pulled away. He was feeling a little embarrassed, and she was a little winded. They ended up devouring the food. And then he went back to work. She sat down in the armchair in front of him. He did not want her to leave. In theory, no one outside the division was authorized to remain on the premises without an official reason, but tonight he did not care about the rules.","_id":"q1242"}

To fill the growing emptiness and calm her anxiety, she had upped her intake of antidepressants.

Right now she wanted to let everything go, to run away from her responsibilities and disappear forever. She was thinking about suicide, especially when she couldn't sleep in the early morning. Why resist? For her son, of course. Wasn't that enough? But Dimitri only had eyes for his father. She was sure she loved Dimitri, but she was incapable of showing him. She remembered when he was little, crawling on all fours, his blond hair a mess as he babbled happily. He was so handsome! What remained of those times? If it were up to him, he would be living with his father full time. Nico, the love of her life, had left her. He had never really loved her. He could have taken his son from her a thousand times, but he hadn't done that. As usual, he was decent. Did he even suspect what condition she was really in? The answer was no, or he would have been there to protect Dimitri and take charge. Damn it! She was going to tell him. Why spare him? She needed a helping hand, his helping hand.","_id":"q1335"}

He and Cohen had led the search of his home personally but had come up with only a few old pictures. Alexandre Becker's past had been reduced to three or so modest shots of Arnaud Briard as a baby and young child, alone and with his mother. His wife was the only person who knew. She seemed kind and even-tempered. The sky had just fallen in on them. Her parents had come to pick up the two children, with Nico's consent; there was no reason to get them mixed up in this terrible story. Kriven's officers had examined the magistrate's schedule in detail. There were some gray areas; they had no way to verify the anonymous phone calls and the impromptu departures from his office.

With a little luck, he wouldn't know, and nobody would get in trouble. Her family thought she was closed up in her office, and she had insisted that she not be bothered. She had drawings to finish for her architecture firm. It was true, but her heart was not in her work. Breathing in the exhaust fumes and other odors of the capital was exactly what she needed. She stopped at a stall in front of a shop and admired the magnificent fruit. She couldn't resist and did some shopping for lunch. She regretted having to go back before anyone noticed her absence. She caught a glimpse of a man who was staring at her, shamelessly devouring her with his eyes. It happened to her all the time. She tried not to give him any attention and continued on her way. Imperceptibly, she started walking faster—and was even becoming sorry about her escapade—until someone ran into her. Some oranges rolled onto the sidewalk. He bent over and picked them up.

In a few hours, Nico had the pathologist's full background. An only child, a middle-class family, divorced parents. Hard time in primary school and observations from a teacher who suspected abuse. An authoritarian mother who was prone to violence had died two years earlier under suspicious circumstances. Thieves had broken into her home and murdered her, according to the police report. Stabbed thirty times. Nico shivered. What if Eric Fiori had killed his mother? What had played out on that day? Fiori was the only one to have a key to that enigma. In a picture, his mother, around the age of thirty, looked surprisingly like the victims. So each time he committed the act, he was attacking his own mother. And he looked for prey that was like his mother. The pieces of the puzzle were coming together. Fiori had a studio apartment in Paris, rented to a student, and an apartment in Nice.

A reinforced door. Nico put his ear to the door, alert to the slightest echo of a voice, any unusual sound. There was nothing. And what if he were wrong? His throat was tight with anxiety. His heart was racing. In his mind, he saw Caroline's face. He surprised himself by praying that he would get her back, that he would finally be able to take her in his arms. What should he do? Shoot out the lock and run across the apartment? If it were the wrong apartment, and the killer and Caroline were not there, he could always apologize and get the owners' door fixed. If he were right, Fiori could kill Caroline in a fit of violence. Maybe it was a better idea to control the balcony and the windows, at the risk of being seen by the criminal. But time was short.

Of the Arcadian Greece of Winckelmann and Walter Pater they were as ignorant as we of the ebony cities of Yoruba and Benin. The scholar poets of the Renaissance, Ambrogio Poliziano and Christopher Marlowe, whose vision of antiquity we have inherited, would have rejected as indecorous this seventh-century world half oriental, half Viking. Archilochos was both poet and mercenary. As a poet he was both satirist and lyricist. Iambic verse is his invention. He wrote the first beast fable known to us. He wrote marching songs, love lyrics of frail tenderness, elegies. But most of all he was what Meleager calls him, \"a thistle with graceful leaves.\" There is a tradition that wasps hover around his grave.

Sparta, not yet rigid with discipline nor fanatically tough and frugal, was what Athens was to become, a city of music and poetry, of games in which boys and girls alike played naked, for modesty's sake. Greek education began there, and thus our own. But Sappho's island, for all the awakening of a new world, dreamed on in antiquity, in touch with the rest of Hellas yet facing the rich and gaudy Lydian empire on the mainland nearby. From here came Sappho's seven-stringed lyre, and the sweetly melancholy mixolydian mode that by one account she introduced into Greek music, and her friend the tall Anaktoria.","_id":"q3485"}

It interests us as the age of Pericles and Plato engaged the Victorians, as Rome of the Republic held the gaze of the eighteenth century. The seventh century's perilous interchange of chaos for order, order for chaos, reminds us of our own. Much was dying, much was being born. Isaiah and Jeremiah, moving in a world much larger than Sappho's, roared at the confusion with fire and vision that we understand all too well. The strenuous flexibility of the rhythms of the next three centuries was beginning. Statues were unfreezing from their Egyptiac stiffness; drawing became graceful, calligraphic, paced like the geometric patterns of weaving and ceramics. Iron was pulling out ahead of bronze. Whole armies, not just the captains, could wield swords.","_id":"q3486"}

This order of the century as it informed its art has become congenial to us through our learning to see Giotto and Altamira, Lascaux and Bulawayo. Within this aesthetic we can place the psychological nakedness of Sappho and her articulation in sunlit space of emotions that we relegate to velleity and aporia.","_id":"q3487"}

Maximus of Tyre saw in Sappho's Comitatus the beginning of the cohering spirit that Socrates refined into philosophical clarity. \"'they both appear to me to have practised the same sort of friendship, he of males, she of females, both declaring that they loved many, for they were captivated by all who were beautiful.

Few societies have been as afraid of the body as ours, and in the West none has, within history, been as solicitous as the Greek of its beauty. The Egyptian eye first saw dignity and suave elegance in the body, transferring man's millennia of appreciation of the animal's splendor to his own physique. The Egyptian, though wigged in porcelain, braceleted, ringed, and painted, went all but naked; women's clothes kept to the contours of the flesh. It was for the Greek to see the natural growth of the body in full health as a beautiful thing, abhorring all mutilations, scarrings, tattooings, elongations of skull, circumcisions, subtractions of teeth or fingers. The old Aphrodite was fat and long of breast and behind, and the cow was her rich sign. Sappho's Aphrodite was slender, trim of line.","_id":"q3491"}

Here are throne rooms, chapels, long stairs, great jars, cypress pillars rising in the most transparent of light. Did not Daedalos build these walls?

Herondas clearly took Hipponax as his master, wrote in his \"limping\" meter and archaic diction, and imitated his satiric stance before the world.

quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"From the street you'd never guess that there could be batting cages in Spencer's. It looks too small; but when you go in, the hallway winds back around, and in the back are three screened-off boxes with pitching machines. Even though there are only a few other batting cages in all of Spokane, there's never a wait for a cage at Spencer's. This is probably because when you're there, you feel like you're in a dungeon. The metal mesh of the cages is old and kind of corroded-looking, like it was once used to trap crabs in Alaska. The lighting sucks—just bare bulbs. The place is dirty and sweaty and gross. It stinks of machine oil and ten-thousand-year-old Deep Heat ointment. The actual pitching machines look like third world torture devices.","_id":"q3661"}

It looked impossible. I'd finished baseball practice and had gone over to the mall to wait for a ride home from my mom. I sat on the side of one of those raised flower-bed things and watched Zeke for maybe twenty minutes. I was a good two hundred feet away from where he was; he didn't even notice me. He kept trying and trying to do the trick, never making it. He'd slide along and go crashing off. He never fell hard on the cement, but he came close to killing himself almost every time. Looking back, I guess it was really kind of cool. I mean, he was practicing the same way that I practice baseball, just trying to master a skill by repeating it over and over until it becomes automatic. I remember thinking at the time that Zeke was an idiot for trying so hard to do a stupid trick on a stupid skateboard.

Matt Tompkins is big, strong, and real quiet. He always has been, even from when we were in the seventh grade. He's been in classes with Travis and me all through our middle school and high school years. He's always gotten by on his bigness and strength and athleticism, but he's a real private guy, and way too serious. Even in baseball he never seems to be having fun.

In his expression is a look of horrible concentration, like I've seen on him only in real tough situations on the ball field a few times. Once when we were playing Kettle Falls, they had a guy on third and two outs in a game we led by one run. Both Matt and I, him at first base and me at third, were told to play way up, to prevent a squeeze play (where the batter bunts and the base runner on third charges home). Of course, there's a danger to playing only twenty feet back from home plate. If the batter swings away, which he almost has to do because you're so close that the squeeze play won't work, there's no way you can get a glove up in time to defend yourself. I remember that day, glancing at Matt for just a second, and wondering if he felt as scared as I did.

Sometimes in baseball, fights are just jokes, but an intentional beaning like this eliminates any possibility of one of those pick-a-partner, dance-around deals.

Matt has made it look like an accident, but I've seen his eyes as he sets it up, moving himself into position, picking the perfect moment, and then striking. The results looks like a stunt in a movie, the way the kid's nose just explodes with blood.

Nope, winning ugly is actually more like not even winning. You have more runs on the board at the end of nine innings—but is that the reason you play?

Priest River scores the go-ahead run in the top half of the ninth inning on a two-out home run by their third baseman, a tall, gangly kid with a good glove who hasn't had a base hit all day. Their team goes wild; they pour out to greet the kid who has hit the dinger and mob him. I know I should be all depressed and down, but I can't stop smiling.

Our coach, Mr. Trefts, pinch-hits Brad Collins for our pitcher, and Brad works a 3–2 count into a walk by fouling off two potential third strikes. Next up, batting just in front of me, is Matt Tompkins. Matt is one for three with a single in the fourth inning. He's our best power hitter, but he also leads the team in strikeouts and at hitting into double plays. If Matt can get on base or at least stay out of a double play, I'll get to hit.

quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"I'm back out at Weaver Lake. It's dark, getting late. The dogs, Evander and Bob, are asleep on the floor of the studio. I'm lying in my sleeping bag in the sleeping loft. Looking out, I see the light from the kitchen window of the house. The moon is shining down on the lake. A few crickets are chirping, and I can smell the fresh-cut grass.","_id":"q4076"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"A few months ago, back in early March, a month before the baseball season even began, Travis was out here for the weekend with me at Weaver Lake.","_id":"q4077"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"On that Saturday morning he and I walked Evander and Bob out around the lake, like we'd done on so many other Saturday mornings before. As we got to the edge of the woods and could look out and see the wheat fields ahead, Bob started a weird, low growl, and the hair on his neck rose up. Evander, who had been padding along ahead of us, stopped, then hurried back to join Bob and began to growl too. My first thought was \"skunk,\" which is usually the nastiest thing you can run into out here. But as I looked ahead more closely, I saw what had set Bob off. It was a small herd of elk.","_id":"q4078"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"\"Look, Trav,\" I whispered excitedly, although there was really no reason to whisper—they were a good 150 yards ahead and the wind was blowing toward us, so they wouldn't catch our scent. There were five of them. They were at the edge of the lake; a couple of cows were drinking, the other grazing. The bull was a big one with a huge, handsome rack, and the three cows were full-grown too. A calf stood near one of the cows, not a newborn but still small.","_id":"q4079"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"Travis softly said, \"Wow.\" We leashed up the dogs and, shushing them as best we could, moved slowly toward the elk.","_id":"q4080"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"\"We'd better not get too close,\" I said. The bull looked more and more massive the closer we got. Even the cows, with a calf to protect, could be dangerous.","_id":"q4081"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"I'd never seen elk in the wild before. I knew they were around, but they're hard to spot. Some hunters buy elk tags every year for twenty years and never even get to fire a shot.","_id":"q4082"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"We walked toward them as close as we felt was safe, about fifty yards out of the woods. We were close enough to run back to the trees if they charged us. With the dogs, I knew we'd be okay so long as we weren't caught in the open.","_id":"q4083"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"We watched them for twenty minutes, maybe longer. When they'd had their fill of water and grazing, they walked slowly off across the field toward the bigger woods farther west.","_id":"q4084"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"That morning there was still even a little ice on the lake, and a small, filthy patch of snow at the foot of a craggy ledge where the sun wouldn't reach until later in the spring.","_id":"q4085"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"That was only a few months ago. This evening, after hanging out with Mom, I walked Evander and Bob back out to where Travis and I had spotted the elk. Of course there were no elk to be seen, and the ice and snow are long gone. In other ways, too, it feels like there's nothing left of that morning with Travis—like the whole world has changed, all for the good. Everything that's happened these last days, everything I remember from my whole life, feels valuable and worth remembering.","_id":"q4086"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"It's great how sometimes, when you let yourself, you can remember the things that make you the happiest, the things that make you feel... I don't know what you'd call it.... Peaceful, I guess.","_id":"q4087"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"The days are getting much longer now, so even though it's close to nine P.M. by the time I get back to the studio and ready for bed, there's still a little bit of light on the western skyline.","_id":"q4088"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"Ten minutes ago the sun was coming through the smudged glass in streaks, oddly shaped shafts of light cutting through the pines and the leaves of the locust trees. Now the sun is low enough, and it doesn't shine directly through the windows anymore. The light is softer. At moments like this, life feels perfect—like nothing bad can ever happen.","_id":"q4089"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"I get my test results back tomorrow, but as worried as I've been about it, now I'm not all that nervous. Whatever the news, it'll be what it'll be and I'll deal with it.","_id":"q4090"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"My ride into town is quiet, just the hum of my tires over the road. I can't think of any music I want to hear. I'm still thinking a lot about everything that's happened over the last week. And, of course, I feel a little bit nervous. Who wouldn't? But in a strange way, the fear is all right.","_id":"q4091"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"As I park my truck and approach the building, there is one thought, one image that keeps playing over and over again in my head. Although I didn't even think about it a single time this last week, with so much going on, right now I can't stop remembering that young mother with her little boy who was here the day I got my blood drawn. She was real worried-looking, and her kid, who was totally unaware of what was happening, was wild and rambunctious, a little shortstop in the making. What's gonna happen to those two if their results come back bad? I mean, I've got my parents, Trav, my teammates, and a whole world of support in my life. What happens to the thousands of moms and little kids all over the world who have nothing like the love I get every day, if their tests come back bad?","_id":"q4092"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"The last time I was here and I saw that mom and her little kid, I said that seeing them creeped me out. That's not how I feel anymore. No, thinking about them now, I just feel sad and worried.","_id":"q4093"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"I get called into Dorothy's office. As she's telling me my results, something in her face, a kind of sadness just under her smile, makes me realize how it must be for her when she has to tell somebody the opposite news of what she's telling me right now.","_id":"q4094"}
quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"I thank her for about the tenth time, and then I stand up to leave. Suddenly, without planning to do it, I reach over and hug her. She hugs me back, and it feels nice.","_id":"q4095"}

quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"When I get out the door to the outside, I run to my truck as fast as I can, almost tripping over a big bulge in the sidewalk where a tree root has pushed up and cracked the cement. I unlock my truck door, hop in, and peel out, my wheels throwing gravel up behind me as I race away. It takes me a couple of blocks to settle down and start breathing normally again.","_id":"q4097"}

quoteDoc (inserted into quote collection): {"book_id":"b5","quote":"My stories are based on things that have happened to me in real life. Living through the losses and heartbreak associated with difficult and challenging moments is way harder than later using the material of those experiences to try and create understanding and compassion in readers. Usually by the time I'm writing a novel about something painful and hard, I've gained enough distance and perspective to approach the material with honesty and, hopefully, a certain level of fearlessness. You can't write realistic fiction if you're a chicken-butt. You have to take risks.","_id":"q4109"}
