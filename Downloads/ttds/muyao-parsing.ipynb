      "line is: It was unthinkable that the lush, fertile landscape could be so deadly, but Diego Alvarez de Castile knew that hell lay concealed beneath the green illusion of paradise.\n",
      "line is: It was their fifteenth day since the battle near the city the Spaniards had called el Gran Cairo—so-named for the towering pyramid-like structures which loomed above the stone houses—thirty-nine days since the expedition set out from Cuba to explore new lands and capture slaves to work the mines and fields of the new Spanish territory. The first meeting with the Indians had gone well. A small party of natives had rowed out to meet them and there had been an exchange of food and other gifts, but the next day, when the Spaniards had made landfall, the Indians had shown their true colors, attacking the landing party with arrows and stones.\n",
      "line is: Although the members of the expedition were not experienced fighters they had anticipated treachery and were armed with muskets and crossbows, and wore steel armor which offered greater protection than the cloth armor worn by the natives. They had held off the attackers long enough to regain the safety of their ships, taking three Indian captives, though at a cost of two Spaniards dead and several more wounded. Still, it had seemed like a victory, particularly when one of the captives began telling—or more precisely, pantomiming—tales of the magnificent riches in the interior. While the main expedition had continued along the coast of what they believed to be an island larger even than Cuba, Alvarez had taken a party of twenty-five able-bodied men to scout the interior and see for themselves if the stories were true.\n",
      "line is: A third of their group—nine men—had perished, lost to the perils of the jungle: wild beasts, venomous snakes and insects, fevers resulting from seemingly insignificant wounds. All who remained were suffering from lesser afflictions that would, if something did not change, eventually destroy them as well. The one danger they had anticipated and prepared for—attacks by hostile Indians—had not materialized, but then neither had they encountered any of the fabled riches. The significance of this was not lost on Alvarez.\n",
      "line is: He confronted their guide, the Indian hostage they had taken to calling Balthasar. \"You tricked us,\" he raged, knowing that his wrath would be more comprehensible to the native than his actual words. He made a cutting gesture with his hand. \"You led us into this wilderness to die. There is no gold. It was all a lie.\"\n",
      "line is: Balthasar quivered in fright, understanding only that the man intended him harm, and waved his arms to placate his captor. He pointed straight ahead, shaking his hand emphatically.\n",
      "line is: He started in that direction, pulling Alvarez along with him.\n",
      "line is: \"No.\" Alvarez shook himself free of the other man's grasp. \"No more of your lies.\"\n",
      "line is: He raised his eyes, looking for the sun through the thick jungle foliage. The expedition had sailed west. If Alvarez turned north now, the small scouting party would reach the coast in a few days, and perhaps find their countrymen waiting. \"We go this way.\"\n",
      "line is: Balthasar's face twisted into a mask of apprehension, and when the party started in this new direction, he resisted, moving only when Alvarez threatened to drag him along at the end of a rope.\n",
      "line is: They hacked through the thick vegetation, advancing only about fifty pasos—the length of a determined man's stride—before the deepening gloom signaled the approach of dusk. Alvarez set half his men to the task of establishing a camp, while the remainder continued blazing a trail in the waning light.\n",

      "line is: At the 19th National Congress, the Communist Party of China (CPC) recognized Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the theoretical guidance that it will adhere to for a long period of time. This step forward provides a clear guide to action: first, in the decisive stage of completing a moderately prosperous society in all respects, second, on a new journey to fully build a modern socialist China, and third, in realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation. Xi Jinping is the principal proponent of this Thought.\n",

It has played a significant role in helping officials and the general public to study and understand Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. It is an important work that helps the international community to better understand China and the CPC. After the 19th CPC National Congress, a second volume of _Xi Jinping: The Governance of China_ was published in November 2017, to help Chinese and foreign readers gain a systematic appreciation of the depth and innovative qualities of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.\n",

Since this book is intended for the classroom, I am anticipating that students reading the _Xunzi_ as part of a course will be introduced to these terms in some fashion (or via some translation) by their instructor. The choice to leave these words untranslated is intended to allow readers to track with great clarity exactly where the terms appear and how they are deployed, and thereby to assess for themselves how best to understand what the words mean in the context of the _Xunzi_. For readers without the aids of an instructor and classroom, or who have no prior exposure to Chinese thought, I have provided explanations of these terms in the footnotes and in appendix 1 that should give them a basic understanding of these concepts, and I have also provided a very brief overview of important ideas in the text in the third section of this introduction.\n",

      "line is: A third way in which this translation is tailored for undergraduate students is that I have limited notes on technical matters to an absolute minimum, since such notes are relevant mostly to readers with advanced skills in classical Chinese, which few undergraduate students possess at this time. The technical notes are indicated with superscript letters and can be found at the end of the book. I have generally indicated only those instances where my reading differs from that found in the major premodern commentaries on the text. So, for example, when I have followed emendations or variant readings suggested by the major premodern commentaries (especially those cited in Wang Xianqian's _Xunzi Jijie_ 荀子集解, which is my base text), I usually have not noted this. In those cases, scholars looking for justifications for particular renderings are encouraged to consult Wang's book and the other works I have used in preparing this translation, which are listed in the bibliography. Overall, I have taken a fairly conservative stance toward the text, and have generally adopted emendations only when it seems to me necessary in order to make sense of it.\n",
      "line is: Compared with explanations of technical matters, I have provided many more notes on matters of historical background and other supplementary information, but in this case also I have tried to limit the explanations to what is most essential for understanding the _Xunzi_ or to what I think will be most useful for undergraduate students. With regard to the former kind of explanation, important names and terms are generally explained in the notes when they first appear in the text, and the index lists in bold type the pages where these introductory accounts are given, for easy reference afterward. Readers requiring more detailed information about people and events mentioned by the _Xunzi_ are encouraged to consult Knoblock's work, which contains copious explanations and references. With regard to the latter kind of material, since the translation may be used as a part of a general course on Chinese thought, I have indicated in the notes a number of places where comparisons with other early Chinese texts are illuminating, with the hope that these citations will encourage students to undertake such comparisons on their own.\n",
      "line is: Two further features of the translation deserve mention here. The first is the numbering system I have deployed. Unlike a number of other early Chinese texts such as the _Analects_ , the _Mencius_ , and the _Daodejing_ , for which there exist standard numbering systems that facilitate ease and precision of references, there is no standard numbering system for the text of the _Xunzi_. There are two concordances that many scholars use as the basis for their references, but since these texts are in Chinese only, they are not accessible to those who cannot read the language. Knoblock numbered the paragraphs of his translation, but the way that his numbering is done can sometimes misleadingly suggest discontinuities in the text's discussions. Moreover, the matter of how to divide the text into paragraphs is itself uncertain and occasionally quite controversial. (My own paragraph divisions mostly follow those of other editions, but in some cases depart from common practice, sometimes for the convenience of English readers.) As an alternative way to facilitate scholarly references, I have provided line numbers for my translation. I have also provided an appendix to aid students who may be trying to track down references in secondary literature on the _Xunzi_ based on the Chinese concordances, or who wish to compare this translation with others. In the notes and appendixes, references to my translation are given in the form \"chapter number.line number\" to enable readers to locate the indicated passages quickly and precisely.\n",
      "line is: The other feature of this translation that warrants comment is the handling of rhymed lines. The _Xunzi_ contains numerous rhymed passages. A number of these are quotations from the _Odes_ , which is an ancient collection of poems—or more accurately, songs—that the _Xunzi_ treats as a repository of wisdom, and which it cites to illustrate and support its claims. Many other rhymed passages appear to be original to the _Xunzi_. (I say \"appear\" because it is always possible that in particular cases the text is quoting, without attribution, from some source now lost to us, but it is doubtful that all of the unattributed passages come from some other source.) Some of these other rhyming passages are probably modeled after the _Odes_ , and some or even all of the rhymed passages may likewise have been intended to be sung aloud, perhaps with the purpose of making the lessons they teach more memorable. However, these rhymes that are not quoted from the _Odes_ have not always been noted in previous translations of the _Xunzi_. Both Watson and Knoblock often overlook them, as do many translations of the _Xunzi_ into modern Chinese and Japanese and Korean.\n",
      "line is: The function of these rhymed sections and their significance for understanding the _Xunzi_ are substantial issues that merit lengthy discussion more appropriate for an article or book than this introduction, but I consider the presence of these rhymes a feature of the text that is sufficiently noteworthy to deserve being reflected conspicuously in the translation. Since the rhyming sections can easily be overlooked (especially by students) if they are indicated merely in footnotes or with offsetting, I have chosen to make them conspicuous by translating rhymed passages in Chinese with rhymed sections of English, _except_ when I felt it beyond my ability or when the constraints imposed by translating in rhyme would necessitate obscuring or misrepresenting something I thought to be of special significance. In such cases, I have left the English text unrhymed and instead resorted to indicating the rhymes in the notes and/or with offset lines.1 For the rhymes in English, I have tried to follow the original rhyme pattern used in the Chinese where possible, but where that made the task of rhyming the English too difficult, I have not followed the Chinese rhymes, on the grounds that I think it more important to convey to students _that_ the text is rhymed than exactly _how_ it is rhymed, as the latter issue is mostly of interest to specialists. For the same reason, I have not noted the original Chinese words that rhyme. The identification of the rhymes in the Chinese text requires detailed knowledge of ancient phonology that I lack, and so I have relied on published studies of rhymes in the _Xunzi_ by other scholars. Since their analyses may have missed some of the rhyming passages, and since there is ongoing scholarly debate about how to reconstruct the sounds of ancient Chinese in the first place, I do not claim to have identified every instance of rhyme in the text, but I do hope to have surpassed previous translations in highlighting this feature of the _Xunzi_.\n",
      "line is: The rhymed sections of the _Xunzi_ , both the quotations from the _Odes_ and the unattributed rhymes, generally display an additional feature, namely fixed line lengths. That is to say, usually the lines are all composed of the same number of Chinese characters, or alternate in the number of characters according to some pattern, which would normally translate to a fixed number of syllables per line if spoken. Awareness of this aspect is important for appreciating the artistry involved in the composition of ancient Chinese verse, for it thus required meeting two distinct challenges, namely getting the lines to rhyme and doing so within the constraint of fixed line lengths. In order to represent the latter feature of the Chinese text, when translating the rhymed passages with English rhymes, in most cases I have adopted lines with fixed numbers of syllables. Since many English words are polysyllabic, however, it is not possible to match the number of syllables in the Chinese lines exactly, so case by case I have picked a limit for the syllables in the English lines, based on what seemed to be the minimum for rendering the Chinese into English with reasonable accuracy.\n",
      "line is: Through translating the rhymed sections in a fashion that simulates the constraints faced by the original composers, I hope to have approximated—not equaled—the artistry that appears in the Chinese text of the _Xunzi_. Although the great scholar of Chinese thought D. C. Lau once claimed that the _Xunzi_ displays \"an indifferent literary style,\"2 I respectfully disagree with his assessment. Even if the _Xunzi_ does not display the imaginative fancy of some early texts, such as the _Zhuangzi_ , the style of writing in the _Xunzi_ is extremely powerful and elegant. While I cannot match this power and elegance in English, I hope that what I have done can in some small measure convey to the English reader a bit of the beauty of the _Xunzi_ 's Chinese text and its mastery of multiple forms of presentation, and that this effect can compensate for the occasional, slight departures from literal accuracy involved in producing the rhymed translations.\n",
      "line is: Last, it is by now a well-worn cliché that \"every translation is an act of interpretation.\" Like any other scholar, I have my own particular views about how best to interpret the text, but in general, I have tried not to inject too many of my own particular readings into the translation, especially where these would be highly idiosyncratic. Readers who compare this work with other translations and commentaries will find that, by and large, I am in agreement with traditional interpretations of the text. Nonetheless, part of my aim has also been to present a reading of the _Xunzi_ that is philosophically coherent, and so in some cases this has meant departing from the consensus view when it has seemed to me that the traditional readings have not done full justice to the content of the text. In most cases, I have discussed these departures in the textual notes or footnotes. Along the way, I have also tried to improve on the efforts of previous translators such as Knoblock and Watson, by consulting published criticisms of their work and taking care to avoid problems pointed out by the critics, when I could agree that their criticisms were justified. I have tried to have good reasons for all the decisions I have made in the course of translating the _Xunzi_ , but since the present work is intended to offer primarily a translation and not a full-scale commentary on the text, I have not attempted to explain all those decisions in this book. No doubt, some readers will question or disagree with the choices I have made, and likely some will rightly identify places where I myself could and should have done better. Even so, if this translation serves to instill in students an appreciation of the _Xunzi_ and a desire to study it further, its purpose will be fulfilled.\n",
      "line is: The received text of the _Xunzi_ is divided into thirty-two sections, which I refer to as \"chapters.\" These chapters (or parts of them) likely circulated as freestanding pieces in ancient China, and probably were never intended to be read in a particular order in the form of a single book, as we now have it. Rather, our received text was first compiled by Liu Xiang (77–6 BCE), who states in his preface that he started with 322 sections of text, which he reduced to our current text of thirty-two chapters, after eliminating \"duplicates\" and performing other editing.3 The sources from which Liu worked are now lost to us, and while future archaeological work may recover pieces of the text that predate Liu's work, we are not at present in a position to know for sure what might have been lost, added, or changed in the process of his editing.\n",
      "line is: This history of the text has certain implications for how to approach it.4 For one thing, in attempting to understand its philosophical content, little significance can be attached to the order of the chapters, since Liu Xiang was apparently the first to combine them in a set, which necessitated giving them some order. Indeed, over the centuries, editors of the _Xunzi_ have felt free to rearrange the chapters on various grounds, and so the arrangements tell us more about the editors' views than about the meaning of the chapters in their original context. The arrangement in this translation follows that of the Tang dynasty edition (818 CE) of Yang Liang, which is the basis for most copies of the _Xunzi_ in print today. A point similar to the first one also applies to the organization of content _within_ the chapters. In particular, some chapters offer rather choppy discussions of a single theme or seem to combine discussions of unrelated topics, but these features of the text may simply be artifacts of Liu's editing, rather than reflecting how the content was originally supposed to be read. Hence, such organization (or as it may be, disorganization) can bear little weight in interpreting the philosophical content or assessing the authenticity of the chapters. The same must be said about the titles of the chapters as well. Some works in ancient China circulated without titles, and there are no records prior to Liu Xiang's edition of the _Xunzi_ of any of the chapter titles of the _Xunzi_ listed by Liu, so he may well have added them himself.\n",
      "line is: Our title for the whole collection of chapters, the _Xunzi_ —which also is most likely an addition by editors—comes from the name of the person, Xunzi, whose thought it purports to record.5 In turn, the name \"Xunzi\" (literally, \"Master Xun\") is an honorific title for the man Xun Kuang 荀況. As is the case for so many other early Chinese thinkers, little is known for sure about his life. There is no firm evidence for his dates of birth and death, and hence scholars have made varying proposals on the matter. To give just a small sample illustrating the diversity of opinions, Qian Mu 錢穆 estimates Xunzi's dates as 340 to 245 BCE, the authors of the Beijing University Philosophy Department commentary as ca. 325 to ca. 235 BCE, You Guo'en 游國恩 as 314 to 217 BCE, and John Knoblock as ca. 315 to ca. 215 BCE.6 While there is thus disagreement about the exact span of his life, there is a fairly strong consensus that Xunzi was active in the latter half of the Warring States period (403–221 BCE). At that time, the power of the nominal ruling dynasty, the Zhou dynasty, was in steep decline, and what was then Chinese territory was divided into several states that were engaged in a violent struggle among themselves for overall supremacy. As can be seen from some of the above estimates of Xunzi's life that favor later dates, he may have lived long enough to see the momentous end of this period, when the state of Qin finished off the last of its rivals to become the sole ruling power in 221 BCE. Indeed, according to early accounts, two of Xunzi's students, Han Feizi and Li Si, were important agents in Qin's rise to dominance, but given Qin's brutal government practices, this association wound up bringing disrepute to Xunzi's name in later history. Judging by the content of the _Xunzi_ , however, he himself apparently would not have approved of Li Si's and Han Feizi's methods.\n",

      "line is: Teddy Xanakis would have to steal the painting. What other choice did she have? She believed it was a Turner—a possibility she couldn't confirm unless she shipped it to the Tate in London, where the Turner scholars, Evelyn Joll and Martin Butlin in particular, could make a judgment about its authenticity. Unfortunately, the painting was currently in the basement of the house that was now solely in Ari's name, where it had sat for years, unrecognized and unappreciated. She might have blamed herself for the oversight, but why on earth would anyone expect to find a priceless painting in such homely company?\n",
      "line is: She and Ari had bought the house when they moved from Chicago to Santa Teresa, California. The estate had been owned by the Carpenters, who passed it down from generation to generation until the last surviving family member died in 1981, having neglected to write a will. The estate attorney had locked the doors and put the house up for sale. Teddy and Ari had bought it fully equipped and fully furnished, right down to the rolls of toilet paper in the linen closet and three sets of sterling flatware in the silver vault. The antiques, including several exquisite Persian carpets, were appraised as part of the purchase price, but in the process a small group of paintings had been overlooked. The attorney had paid the taxes owed, handing the IRS and the State of California the hefty sums to which they were entitled.\n",
      "line is: Teddy and Ari had made use of a number of the antiques in furnishing the mansion's first and second floors. The rest they'd moved into the complex of storage rooms below. The paintings were in a cabinet in an upright rack, each leaning against its neighbor. Teddy had come across them shortly after they moved in. Over the years she'd developed an eye for fine art, but these paintings were drab and uninteresting. The subject matter was classical: nymphs, mythological figures, Roman ruins, a seascape, heavy-legged peasant women bringing in the harvest, a still life with a dead duck and rotting fruit, and a floral arrangement in colors she didn't care for.\n",
      "line is: It was after she and Ari divorced and they'd both signed off on the settlement that she'd realized one of the paintings she'd so carelessly dismissed might be an original by Joseph Mallord William Turner, whose work sold at auction in the millions.\n",
      "line is: 1. Ari had no appreciation of art. The collection she'd put together comprised the works of a group known as Les Petits-Maîtres—minor Impressionists like Bartoli, Canet, Jacques Lambert, and Pierre Louis Cazaubon, whose paintings were still affordable because the artists themselves had never achieved the legendary stature of Cézanne, Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh, and their ilk. The collection had already been awarded to her in the settlement, so why not this one small additional painting?\n",
      "line is: 2. If Ari realized the true value of the painting, they'd only get into another wrangle as to which of them was entitled to it. If they couldn't agree, which seemed inevitable, a judge could force a sale and divide the money equally between them. In this one tiny instance, money didn't interest her. The Turner was a treasure she'd never see again in her lifetime and she was determined to have it.\n",
      "line is: 3. Ari had already screwed her over once, quite literally, by having a dalliance with Stella Morgan, the woman Teddy had once considered her best friend.\n",
      "line is: Stella's husband, Douglas, was the architect who'd designed the remodel of a condominium Ari and Teddy owned in downtown Santa Teresa. It was while he was overseeing construction that he was stricken with a fatal heart attack. Months passed. After the remodeling work was finished, Ari and Teddy continued to see Stella, who had adjusted to her widowhood as best she could with all that money as compensation.\n",
      "line is: Then came disaster. That September Teddy spent a weekend in Los Angeles, attending a seminar at the Getty on the Plein Air Painters. On Monday when she arrived home, she hadn't been in the house an hour before an acquaintance rang her up and gave her a blow-by-blow. Teddy's options were limited: fight, flight, play dead, or screw him. She'd slapped Ari with divorce papers within the week.\n",
      "line is: He got the house, which she couldn't afford to maintain in any event. She got the flat in London. He got a sizable chunk of jewelry, including the necklace he'd given her for their tenth anniversary. She freely confessed she was bitter about that. The stocks and bonds had been sorted out between them. The division was fair and square, which pissed her off no end. There was nothing fair and square about a cheating husband who'd boffed her best friend. In a further cruel twist of fate, in the division of their assets, Teddy had been awarded the very condominium where the architect had breathed his last.\n",
      "line is: More real estate was the last thing she needed. Her broker priced the condo at a million plus and assured her of a quick sale. After the apartment sat for eighteen months without a nibble, Teddy decided the place would be more attractive if it were properly furnished and decorated. She'd hired a Santa Teresa stager named Annabelle Wright and instructed her to cherry-pick the items in Ari's basement for that purpose. He agreed because the hostilities had gone on long enough and he wanted her out of his hair.\n",

      "line is: Over the past few years, growing attention has been paid to the changes that are quietly reshaping China and to the governance philosophies of Xi Jinping, its new steersman. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, the new generation of China's leadership headed by Xi has been pressing the Chinese Dream forward with an unparalleled level of resolve and political wisdom. A new era is on the horizon to witness the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. For its many achievements, the Chinese leadership enjoys the love and support of the Chinese people, and has won wide acclaim around the globe.\n",
      "line is: In a few years' time, President Xi has developed his philosophical thinking on the governance of China into a system to address the pressing issues of China, to develop and improve Chinese socialism, and to achieve modernization in all areas. His ideas also contain the guiding principles for building a new world order and influencing the future of human society.\n",
      "line is: Studying, understanding, and implementing these philosophies on governance is a pressing political task of the CPC and the nation. Only by fully understanding these philosophies can we apply them in our work. This will not be an easy task for it requires the whole Party to put in extra effort.\n",
      "line is: Zhou Xinmin's new book, Xi Jinping's Governance and the Future of China, explains the characteristics and patterns of President Xi's governance philosophy from the perspective of core capabilities required of the Chinese leadership. This book can also serve as a reference to help CPC members and officials absorb and internalize key concepts.\n",
      "line is: In recent years, as the education campaign rolls out to study President Xi's speeches and thoughts, interpretations in various forms have been made available in the market. Compared to previous works, this book has something new to offer. It has moved away from literal interpretation in a general sense, and employs a new perspective to focus on core capabilities—the supporting element behind governance philosophies—to conduct an in-depth analysis that is accessible and comprehensive.\n",
      "line is: There is no doubt that with more practice, the philosophical system will continue to develop and improve while enriching its contents. The essential capabilities of leadership, the decisive and fundamental pillars of the system, will not change with the times. This book explains the achievements, strategies, and development of the president's governance practice, and showcases the vision and capacities of the new generation of CPC leadership. This will undoubtedly help readers and Chinese officials at all levels in understanding President Xi's thoughts.\n",
      "line is: Theories are meant to guide practice, therefore we must understand these theories before implementing them in the key strategies and policies of the CPC and the state, and use them to guide our action. With this book in hand, CPC members and officials will find it easier to understand the principles and key concepts, and use it as a guidebook to measure their performance against the president's standards. Officials must study and practice these rules, continue to enhance their capacities, and perform their duties in a way that follows the example of the leadership in national governance.\n",
      "line is: Divided into seven chapters, this book builds upon the main theme of capabilities and employs a step-by-step approach in detailing its meaning with clear logic and rigorous deduction. Chapter 1, Achievements of Xi Jinping's Practice of Governance, offers a comprehensive account of the CPC leadership's governance philosophies, measures, and accomplishments. Chapter 2, Interpreting Xi Jinping's Governance Philosophies, makes an in-depth analysis of the guiding thoughts. Chapter 3, Practice of Xi Jinping's Governance Philosophies, discusses the policies and methods employed. Chapter 4, The Governance of Great Leaders, summarizes the common traits of outstanding leaders. Chapter 5, Core Capabilities of Xi Jinping's Governance, analyzes President Xi's competence as China's leader. Chapter 6, Development of Xi Jinping's Governance Capabilities, traces back to the origin of Xi's capabilities and follows his developmental path. Chapter 7, Setting Standards for Leading Capabilities, explores the values extended from the capabilities of national governance. It is my hope that, by discussing these theories, the book will play a central role in influencing and molding generations of CPC members and officials who are committed to CPC's mission, Chinese socialism, and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It is also my hope that it will help the modernization of China's governance system and capabilities, and shed some light on achieving the Chinese Dream.\n",
      "line is: Karl Marx once said, \"Every beginning is difficult.\" The research on President Xi's governance philosophies is in its initial stage, with very few studies on the supporting capabilities behind the system. As a pioneer in this area, the author explains his original ideas in this work, some of which are yet to be tested through practice. I genuinely hope that the book will become the centerpiece in the education campaign on governance for CPC members and officials, and that it will enhance the implementation of President Xi's thinking on governance in China.\n",
      "line is: Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2012, the CPC central leadership led by Xi Jinping has been pressing reform forward in all areas by introducing new policies in governing the nation, the CPC, and the military. It has managed domestic development and Chinese foreign relations with a global vision, driven reform to a deeper level, and launched a new voyage of the People's Republic of China (PRC) towards prosperity. A new era has begun for both CPC's mission and for the renewal of China.\n",
      "line is: Over the past few years, we have witnessed remarkable progress in China's governance. The achievements and progress in governance have never been so evident. These achievements have given the Chinese people new hope, new aspirations, and new dreams. The expectation is that over the next few years, and the years that follow, China will make even greater progress in its reform and development and that the CPC will continue to consolidate its foundation of governance, explore new heights of governance, continue to make the Chinese proud, and leave the world in wonder.\n",

      "line is: She found the men didn't always say yes, at least not immediately. Sometimes, they were worried they might be part of a practical joke. Then, she had to convince them. \"They were apprehensive, and curious,\" she says. Which seems reasonable; nothing in their life so far would have convinced them that this was a plausible scenario. Notwithstanding, most took a punt on it eventually and agreed to sleep with her.\n",

      "line is: If he had said yes then, like all the other men, a few seconds later he would have learnt the offer was a sham. Because no one ended up having sex. These Danish students were repeating an experiment on gender differences in casual sex that is not just a classic in the field, it is probably _the_ classic in the field. In fact, it has even inspired a pop song.\n",

I have seen scientists attacked for suggesting there are innate differences between male and female brains; I have seen scientists attacked for saying there aren't.

      "line is: Richard Heslop's brilliant account of the work of an officer in the British Special Operations Executive controlling resistance operations in German-occupied France is one of the most stirring special operations memoires ever written. With an exhilarating opening featuring what was clearly one of the most traumatic moments in Heslop's life, the pace never slackens. Xavier, the title of the book, was Heslop's fieldname on the ground in France. He was codenamed Marksman, the leader of the SOE's network, or 'circuit', of the same name which operated in the Savoie/Haute-Savoie/Ain area which stretches from Lyon in the west to the Swiss border, but his false documents listed him as René Garrat, a French factory worker by day while leading or plotting the attacks on the Germans by night.\n",
      "line is: The role of the resistance behind occupied lines in France is well known, celebrated in numerous war films and by a host of statues and monuments dotted around the French countryside. The main resistance groups were each controlled by an 'organiser' like Heslop, but what is less well known is the importance of their operations during the invasion of Europe in June 1944. Since the Marksman circuit dominated most of the situation reports put out by SOE's 'F Section' in the days after the D-Day landings, it is appropriate that as this Dialogue edition of this book was published, the few remaining veterans of D-Day were celebrating the seventieth anniversary of the Normandy landings.\n",
      "line is: The work of Heslop's Marksman circuit in the weeks ahead of the invasion and in the immediate aftermath tied down large numbers of German troops with his numbers growing all the while, from just over 1,000 initially, to more than 3,000 by mid-May and thousands more within days of the landings as patriotic French men and women took up arms to add to the pressure on the Germans.\n",
      "line is: The extent to which the Marksman circuit expanded is reflected in Heslop's repeated pleas in his reports to London (included here as an appendix) for more arms and ammunition both of which were by now in far shorter supply than enthusiastic resistance fighters. In a fascinating foreword to the book, Colin Gubbins, the operational head of SOE, refers to the difficulty they had in making the necessary supply drops with resources, and in particular aircraft, understandably stretched to the limit.\n",
      "line is: Gubbins rightly pays a glowing tribute to the resistance fighters who worked under Heslop. The Communist Maquis − described in his reports as fighting 'like tigers' − were largely ignored by the authorities in post-war Gaullist France, so there is a timely reminder of the importance of their role, both in Heslop's own account and in his situation reports, included here as an appendix.\n",
      "line is: But just as much as it emphasises the bravery of the Maquis and the other resistance fighters working with Heslop, it is also a timely reminder of his own bravery. He is rarely mentioned in histories of the SOE in France. This welcome new edition of _Xavier_ rights that wrong.\n",
      "line is: The job which led to my most disturbing incident as a British agent started quite simply when I met one of the many dozens of resistance men I had worked with in the Angers area. I saw him in a bar, and as we sat over a coffee one morning in mid-1943, he told me that he could let me have all the future train movements for months to come, every ammunition train, every troop train, every food train, which had been planned with characteristic German efficiency and listed in one slim file which rested in a steel drawer inside the movement control office at Le Mans station.\n",
      "line is: I was, of course, instantly aware of the value of this information. Armed with it, I could brief the Royal Air Force to attack the trains and could let the saboteurs in the groups know when food trains were passing so that they could be derailed and the goods taken into the secret stores of the Resistance. How, I asked, were these plans to reach me?\n",
      "line is: 'Monsieur, I have a contact at Le Mans who is a movements control officer. He can tell you where they are kept and you can come in and get them.'\n",
      "line is: He explained that there was only one guard on at nights, a Frenchman, and that he could be tempted away by the offer of a couple of brandies in a bar close by the offices. He would leave a shutter open in a ground-floor room and the window unlocked so I could come in that way. There would be no problem. As for locked doors, he would give me wax impressions of the only key I would need which opened the door from the room with the open shutters into the room where the file was kept, but he would even try to keep that unlocked for the night I would make my burglary.\n",

Part frontier science, part mystery adventure, part alien language manual, and part interdisciplinary philosophy, this uniquely envisioned book is impossible to categorize in any traditional form. Slattery breaks new ground, bravely exploring the fascinating relationship between symbolic representation, psychonaut 'downloads,' consciousness, and reality. Future generations will surely recognize this cutting-edge book for helping to establish the foundation of humanity's post-larval entry into the extraterrestrial and inter-dimensional arenas of interspecies communication. Masterfully crafted, alchemically blending a wide range of perspectives, and overflowing with fascinating details about secret languages, rare treasures composed of unusual information, and profound insights elegantly expressed. Psychedelic explorers, science fiction lovers, and students of the unexplained will savor every sentence in this brilliant and thought-provoking book. You can bet that the aliens are certainly paying attention!\"\n",
      "line is: \"Diana Reed Slattery's Xenolinguistics is an extraordinary work: at once a heroic and breathtaking psychonaut's tale, a highly original philosophical treatise concerning what happens at the edge of language and beyond, and a neurophenomenological meditation that beckons us towards sciences of the future.\"\n",
      "line is: \"Seen through the lens of her perspectives on language, Slattery's Xenolinguistics provides a comprehensive introduction to the possibilities of disciplined exploration of non-ordinary states of consciousness. Her work catalogues the ways that transdimensional reality may be accessed and explicates its utility as a kind of cosmic search engine from which information on individual self-transformation and collective human ventures may be gathered in a systematic and expedient way.\"\n",
      "line is: \"The ineffable Other has a faithful scribe, and it is Diana Reed Slattery. Slattery has crafted the first codex of languages reaching back to us from the unspeakable. Magic was always incanted into being through alien languages. Slattery has reopened the linguistic doorway for our return to magic. She bravely glided behind the mesh of the cosmos and returned with the news: it's all built of language!\"\n",
      "line is: \"The intersection of human language and the psychedelic experience was initially brought to light through the work of Terence McKenna. Since his death in 2000, however, there has been far too little work in this field. In fact, I know of only one person who is qualified to take it to the next level. That person is Diana Reed Slattery. Her scholarly background, coupled with a deep understanding of psychedelic culture, places Diana in a perfect position to help us explore one of the central features of our lives, language. Whether you are an experienced psychonaut or budding linguist, Xenolinguistics: Psychedelics, Language, and the Evolution of Consciousness is a book that belongs in your personal library.\"\n",
      "line is: \"Slattery provides us with a first-person ethnographic account of the psychonautic landscape where a first-person science—phenomenological methods and self-reflexivity—organizes her encounters in entheogenic realms. She places psychedelic experiences within a discourse on the phenomenology of knowledge and epistemology and other psychonautic accounts. Her analyses provide a transdisciplinary scope for analyzing the nature of entheogenic worlds. Slattery illustrates how psychedelic technologies extend perception and the senses and permit a reorganization of reality within which the psychonaut functions as an ontological engineer of the entheogenic landscape. The book examines psychedelics in terms of their effects in enhancing certain aspects of extended perception and the increased focus on the mechanics of the formation of perception and reality. A combination of phenomenological description and neurological analysis leads us to a glimpse of a neurophenomenological understanding of the neurognostic landscape of crystal vision, extended perception, hyperconnectivity, hyperconductivity, and multilayered realities and consciousness. Xenolinguistics' engagement with entheogenic realities through dialogue with the alien other and emergent xenolinguistic systems instills a zest for the exploration of the further realms of consciousness.\"\n",
      "line is: \"Effing the ineffable—how to communicate the wordless unspeakable, think the preconceptual, visualize the invisible, symbolize the powerful-vague—psychedelicists and other travelers to other realms of consciousness have been stumped by these topics for millennia. By collecting current and historical examples, Slattery's Xenolinguistics tackles these conundrums, applies current consciousness theories, and sheds light into these esoteric corners of human communication. Xenolinguistics challenges its readers to wrestle with these topics and to pursue further explorations. The result? A sort of psychedelic psycholinguistics plus an ineffable more.\"\n",

      "line is: There is a man alone in a room. Maybe he didn't know how he got there, and starts to find the whole of his previous existence baffling, his memories of life outside the room tenuous and incoherent, his own sense of self-identity fraught and enigmatic: he could be one of the heroes of Beckett's Trilogy. Sometimes the man has been wandering through \"the wilderness of this world\" and has lighted in a certain place where he goes to sleep, and dreams of the City of Destruction and the path that leads from it, through Vanity Fair and past Doubting Castle, to the Celestial City: Bunyan's Pilgrim. Another man living alone in a room also goes to sleep, and sees his home town of Combray, and high-society life in Paris and apple trees on a rainy spring day in Normandy: Proust's Narrator. (Perhaps the real last words of In Search of Lost Time, accidentally omitted in all existing editions, are: \"So I awoke, and behold it was a Dream.\")\n",
      "line is: The ideas that visit a man in a room can have momentous implications. On 10th November 1619, a soldier returning to the army of Duke Maximilian of Bavaria from the coronation of Ferdinand II in Frankfurt was detained by the harsh winter weather and took up quarters near Ulm, in a room with a stove, where he found the leisure to think through some of the metaphysical perplexities that had been preoccupying him: the soldier was Descartes, and the result of his wintry, room-bound ponderings was the Cogito, inaugurating a new epoch in philosophy.\n",
      "line is: Xavier de Maistre's A Journey around My Room and its successor, A Nocturnal Expedition, are akin to all of these. Like Molloy and Malone and other of Beckett's almost immobilized but unstoppably loquacious protagonists, de Maistre finds that isolation from society, and the relative absence of stimuli from the world outside, lead him to question his identity (though in a much more relaxed and debonair way than in Beckett), make him reflect on the unstable flux of experience that the practical needs of \"ordinary\" life tend to conceal, and force him to supplement the paucity of events in the room by resorting to memory, imagination, daydream and storytelling – which sometimes seem to merge into one another. The dimensions of the room vary in accordance with his subjective moods: sometimes the four walls are a little claustrophobic, but more often the room suddenly turns out to be vast in its dimensions, as if the distance from his armchair to his desk suddenly constituted a huge and almost uncrossable terrain (shades of Beckett again: and anyone who has ever suffered post-viral fatigue will know just how he feels).\n",
      "line is: Like Bunyan, de Maistre euphemizes his time in the room: like Bunyan, he was in fact imprisoned there (de Maistre was confined to house arrest for forty-two days over a duelling incident). There is little of Bunyan's evangelizing fervour in de Maistre's dreams and visions, and yet in his work too there is a \"city of destruction\" in the background: the Paris of the French Revolution. Xavier de Maistre was the brother of that Prince of Reactionaries, Joseph de Maistre, whose writings (which Baudelaire, with a degree of irony that is difficult to judge, and possibly without any irony at all, claimed had \"taught him how to reason\") promoted an unflinching Papal absolutism, a stubborn monarchism and a hair-raising cult of the sacramental significance of the death penalty (in the specific shape of the executioner), as the only authentic response to the ills of modernity. Xavier was less systematic in his politics than Joseph, but the charm of the Journey goes hand in hand with his conviction that Paris had, as a result of the events following 1789, become the capital city of the Antichrist, which he can contemplate with horrified fascination from the (relatively) safe haven of Turin. And Xavier's apparently desultory meditations not only turn his room (his prison) into the launching pad for some understated but insistent political opinions (quite the opposite of Bunyan's, of course); they also turn the microcosm of his seclusion into a macrocosm that ranges in epic (or mock-epic) style through time and space, and incidentally (and somewhat unexpectedly) includes some favourable comments on that very un-reactionary character, the Satan of Bunyan's contemporary, Milton.\n",
      "line is: Like Proust's Narrator, de Maistre finds that enclosure within four walls is a necessary precondition for writing about the life he lived outside them; and like Descartes, he concocts his own (much more whimsical) philosophical system, delightfully brief and refreshingly devoid of metaphysical angst (see Chapter 16 of the Expedition). On a rather more sustained note, he indulges in a fanciful reprise of Cartesian dualism, which is given two different variant forms in the Journey and the Nocturnal Expedition: the experience of being alone will naturally tend to lead to an obsession with \"reflection\" (indeed, in the Journey, with mirrors) and with the sense of doubling that is forced on anyone who can think but not act, or is obliged, for company, to talk to himself. (A paradoxical idea: when we talk to ourselves, who is doing the talking and who is doing the listening?) But then, in all these cases, solitude in a room leads above all to writing, which is almost as odd (can I write without also reading?).\n",
      "line is: What do you write about, from inside your room? Both the Journey and the Expedition oscillate between inside and outside – between an examination of the author's immediate environment and speculating about, or remembering, or anticipating what lies beyond it. An enumeration of the things in one's room can be highly instructive. Nothing is more taken for granted, and yet nothing can say more about who we are than the things with which we have surrounded ourselves. De Maistre, being under house arrest, uses his enforced solitude to contemplate the artefacts and commodities around him, and makes them strange. All that was close – so close as to be almost invisible – becomes far: becomes, at times, a pretext for imaginative fugues that lead in all sorts of unpredictable directions.\n",
      "line is: De Maistre has had several successors in the art of \"travelling around your room\": two of the more recent are Daniel Spoerri and Georges Perec. Spoerri's An Anecdoted Topography of Chance is a highly complex text which weaves commentaries of almost Talmudic detail around the objects lying at random (in so far as anything is random) on the table in his room, which thus become the pretext for associations of ideas, chains of memory, stories and anecdotes which in turn bristle with footnotes, and footnotes on footnotes, that mimic such earlier \"encyclopedic\" works as the seventeenth-century Critical Dictionary of Pierre Bayle. It is also faithful to the spirit of de Maistre in its digressions and parenthetical remarks and general indifference to the straight line which (as Doctor Who and other sages have observed) may be the shortest way of getting from one place to another but is not necessarily the most interesting. (De Maistre pays explicit homage to another great exponent of the squiggle and the diversion and the sudden flight of fancy, also mentioned by Spoerri: the Sterne both of Tristram Shandy and of that \"journey\" which, despite its title – A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy – characteristically never gets any farther than Lyon.)\n",
      "line is: And Perec too refuses to indulge in contempt for what is familiar, and is happy (and sometimes alarmed) to find infinite space in a nutshell. His manic attention to the world's visible surfaces, his love of objects – both as things and as the bearers of rich and mysterious meanings – were often brought to bear on his most immediate working environment. In Espèces d'espaces (literally, \"types of spaces\") he meditates on the page on which he is writing, and then moves out successively to the bed (where, among other things, he has spent so much time reading), the bedroom, the apartment, the block, the street, the town, Europe, the world, space. This is reminiscent of de Maistre's flights of cosmic fancy winging out from the confines of his cell, though de Maistre has none of Perec's more sociological obsession with classification (how do we define the different spaces in which we live, and how are they related to one another?). Perec's Penser/Classer (Thoughts of Sorts, literally \"thinking/classifying\") foregrounds in its very title his more theoretical concerns, and at times restricts itself to an even smaller topography than his room – like Spoerri, he notes the objects that are on his work-table (the lamp, the ashtray, several stones, a lump of lead, etc. – though as he comments, if you are going to make a list you must try your best to avoid the amnesia and impatience of an \"etc.\") and ponders on the possibility of writing the history of some of them: how they came to be there, and what they might say about his habits or his changing tastes. This is similar to de Maistre's cataloguing of the paintings on his walls – though again, there is a downbeat and ruminative tone to de Maistre which is quite different from Perec's probing, intense, high-voltage gaze, obsessed with not leaving anything out, not forgetting a single thing: after all, the history from which Perec emerged – he came from a Jewish family, his father died in the early days of the Second World War, his mother was deported and almost certainly perished in Auschwitz – forced him to cling with grim tenacity to everything, since once you start forgetting a single detail, you are yielding to an amnesia that might swallow up even the most tragic and momentous events, such as the Shoah.\n",
      "line is: And this may put de Maistre's Journey and Expedition in a slightly different light. It would, of course, be a shame to deprive them of the \"charm\" which many readers have quite rightly found in them. But like all those other men in rooms, writing about the things around them and using them as pretexts for ever-expanding musings, de Maistre is, after all, in reality, \"cabined, cribbed, confined\". They are all prisoners (of time and history as well as place), forced to use their imagination to transcend the claustrophobia of their condition: by turning their gaze to their immediate environment, are they looking for a key to help them escape, or are they so resigned to seclusion that they are content merely, as it were, to decorate the walls of their prison cells? The question as posed sets up a false antithesis: maybe a close and scrupulous attention to the prison cell (or \"the world\") is a way of escaping it, or a precondition for some change in circumstances that would be tantamount to an escape. But all of these writers make us reflect on the extent to which writing both connects with the world (the \"outside\") and holds it at bay; can be both social – think of de Maistre's kindness, however hedged about with the ironies of Shandean sentimentalism it may be, and the way he always seems to be addressing someone – and solitary, longing for a reality to which it constantly refers while at the same time dallying with the idea that its own imaginative musings may ultimately be more satisfactory (and perhaps even more real). The journey around your room may be as good as any trip around that slightly bigger but equally finite room, the world. De Maistre is glad to leave house arrest at the end of the Journey, but already nostalgic, too, for the paradoxical liberty it gave him – and all too happy to return, in the nocturne of the Expedition, to an exploration of that inner space. For the apparent inwardness and retreat of writing (what Erich Heller called \"the artist's journey into the interior\") may paradoxically be a better way of exploring, not just the great outdoors (hence the plethora of cultural references in de Maistre's text), but a quite different dimension as well: the Great Outside.\n",
      "line is: I've read that too much travelling is an utter waste of time.\n",
      "line is: No, I will no longer keep my book to myself; here it is, gentlemen: read it. I have undertaken and completed a forty-two-day journey around my room. The interesting observations I have made, and the continual pleasure I experienced en route, filled me with the desire to publish it; the certainty of being useful was the decisive factor. My heart senses an inexpressible satisfaction when I think of the countless unhappy people to whom I am here offering a sure and certain resource against boredom, and an alleviation of the ills they endure. The pleasure you find in travelling around your room is safe from the restless jealousy of men; it is independent of the fickleness of fortune.\n",

      "line is: Xenophon of Athens was a historian and a genuine hero of ancient Greece. Born in 431 B.C., he was at the height of his powers when he wrote his Cyrus epic. The insights about leadership that are revealed in this book have inspired great men from Julius Caesar to Benjamin Franklin to Lawrence of Arabia.\n",
      "line is: Far more than most books on leadership, Xenophon's masterpiece possesses deeply ethical and profoundly spiritual qualities, which were to be expected from a man who had sat at the feet of Socrates. There is little doubt that Xenophon was remembering the wisdom that he learned from Socrates during his writing of Cyrus.\n",
      "line is: A descendant of Xenophon's manuscript, _Cyrus the_ _Great_ dramatizes the methods of leadership used by the Persian emperor, who is remembered as the most magnificent monarch of the ancient world. The course of Cyrus the Great's career was triumphant throughout, so this book is, quite simply, one of the greatest success stories ever written.\n",
      "line is: Cyrus the Great (ca. 580–529 B.C.) founded the Persian Empire in the sixth century B.C. by uniting the Medes and the Persians, the two original Iranian tribes. Ultimately, Cyrus' Persian Empire extended from India to the Mediterranean Sea and was the most powerful state in the world until its conquest two centuries later by Alexander the Great. Although Cyrus flourished a century before Xenophon's own time, he was an apt choice to represent the ideal leader. This great Persian's astonishing military successes and mild rule provided just the kind of raw material that Xenophon needed to fashion his portrait of a human paragon.\n",
      "line is: Plato, another of Socrates's celebrated disciples, praised Cyrus the Great as the very model of an enlightened monarch. What Moses was to the Israelites, Cyrus was to the Persians. When Cyrus conquered Babylon, he was cheered by the Hebrews for freeing them from their captivity and allowing more than forty thousand Jews to leave Babylon and return to the Promised Land. Because of his benevolence and his innermost desire to allow mankind to live in peace, Cyrus the Great is immortalized in the opening verses of Isaiah 45.\n",
      "line is: Even those subjugated by Cyrus the Great considered him an eminently just and upright man. Shapour Suren-Pahlav of the University of London notes that the Persians regarded him as the \"Father,\" the Babylonians as the \"Liberator,\" the Greeks as the \"Law-Giver,\" and the Jews as the \"Anointed of the Lord.\"\n",
      "line is: A document in the form of a cuneiform cylinder was discovered in 1878 during the excavation of a Babylonian site. That document, in which Cyrus describes his humane treatment of the Babylonians after his conquest of the city, is acknowledged as mankind's first charter of human rights. In recognition of this achievement, the United Nations published a translation of Cyrus' Human Rights Charter in each of the official U.N. languages.\n",
      "line is: The historian Will Durant points out that Cyrus the Great \"was the most amiable of conquerors, and founded his empire upon generosity. His enemies knew that he was lenient, and they did not fight him with that desperate courage which men show when their only choice is to kill or die.\"\n",
      "line is: No other leader throughout antiquity can match the scope of Cyrus' achievements. Though Alexander the Great (356–323 B.C.) is sometimes considered to be a greater military tactician, he indulged in excesses that would have made Cyrus the Great blanch.\n",
      "line is: Whereas Cyrus treated the peoples he conquered with deep respect, Alexander sometimes urged his soldiers to put civilian populations to the sword. As his domains widened, Alexander increasingly gave himself over to tyrannical methods and monstrous egotism. Had any of Cyrus' generals acted with a cruelty equal to Alexander's, he would have been relieved of his duties immediately.\n",
      "line is: A deeply humane man in his own right, Xenophon would have found it natural to develop a sense of spiritual kinship with the founder of the Persian Empire. They both had many opportunities to master the military virtues: Xenophon's own leadership skills were sharpened during his service as a battlefield commander where indecision would have meant defeat and death.\n",

At the time I thought, somewhat cynically, that the publisher involved must have been thinking that it would be a good idea to get me to put my story down because it was likely that I was not long for this world. While recovering from major surgery, I had written a short novel about the last days of a hit man, but the editor assigned to me by my publisher insisted that it was my story they really wanted. I did actually finish the novel as a film script but it never went anywhere further.\n",
      "line is: I then started to look through various clippings that had made some mention of me, in an attempt to research myself, the way I imagined a proper writer would. But I quickly abandoned this idea.\n",
      "line is: I did examine various diaries I had written over the years but the entries were sporadic and while I thought they might prove useful at later times for specific references, they didn't seem to have either continuity or narrative flow. I tried talking to a few old acquaintances but their points of view varied so much from mine that the book would have ended up as a series of other people's impressions of me.\n",
      "line is: In the end I decided to go to the most reliable source. The music. It seemed to be the only thing that accurately catalogued my progression as a person. Even the Sonics on a record brought back vivid memories about the way I had felt at that time.\n",
      "line is: The next issue I had to confront was my identity. I had read several other auto biogs but didn't want mine to be a simple recollection of names, dates and places. My life has been full of \"subtext\" almost as though I had had no identity before I discovered song writing. I had been to art school, not especially successfully, but I discovered that nothing provided me with as much freedom as did song.\n",
      "line is: I am not qualified as a psychoanalyst so I won't pretend to fully understand how I have evolved emotionally. My life, it seems to me, has been vague and unstructured. I have never been convinced that even fact is black and white. Facts are the domain of historians: although a sequence of facts put down in a time line can convey a certain type of journey, they tend to rush to a conclusion in order to wrap up the whole story in a neat package.\n",
      "line is: Maybe my real life has existed as a sub plot to my songs. All I will say is that the young 19-year-old me written about in the book is as true and accurate account of myself as anything you will read in a newspaper clipping. That 19-year-old boy is still inside me, insecure, living with a sense of foreboding about his world. All his insecurities are there. In a similar way, the 70-year-old RD has always been inside me. I'm not qualified to dissect this, and I wouldn't even know where to start.\n",
      "line is: Finally, this book is really like a long song or series of songs. I switch persona and tense as often in this book as I do in my songs. It's not an attempt to be literal but when I finished it I thought there was a good deal of heartfelt truth. I may have approached the writing process a little differently from most, but at the time I wrote X-Ray I could not have written it any other way. The voice drifts from first to third person, even in gender as in many of my songs. Even time and space are sometimes in doubt.\n",
      "line is: Written with a mixture of young man's innocence and perhaps sometimes an older man's cynicism, when I look back on _X-Ray_ now, I wonder if I should have made the story shorter, but it too is history and I think it must stand for what it is. The style might strike some as naïve but then most of my songs that people enjoy best are like that too.\n",
      "line is: When I set out on this journey I had no idea how much writing _X-Ray_ would affect my life or more to the point how much it would denote how much my life was in transition. The Kinks stopped touring shortly around the time _X-Ray_ was first published, but in a way this went unnoticed due to the fact that in my one-man show I sang many old hits for two or three hours and talked about the band. Since the first publication of the book my life has changed drastically. _X-Ray_ projected me into another phase of my life. The events that have taken place since would probably fill another book. What remains is an impression of a time in which I am glad and lucky to have lived.\n",
      "line is: _X-Ray_ also served, albeit unexpectedly, as a foundation for my one-man show which evolved first as a book reading, then as a one-man show which I ended up performing all over the world, which inspired a VHI television series called Storyteller.\n",

      "line containing intro word is: While the _Analects_ and _Mencius_ were provided with commentaries by late Han scholars, the _Xunzi_ unfortunately did not enjoy this attention until much later. The earliest commentary is by the Tang scholar Yang Liang, and it is upon his edition, preface dated A.D. 818, that all later texts of the work are based. Further information on the texts and commentaries utilized in my translation will be found at the end of this introduction.\n",

      "line is: Among Chinese philosophers, Xunzi is perhaps remembered primarily for the latter view, dourly asserting that human nature is basically evil. His fellow countrymen, who despite severe buffeting at the hands of history have over the centuries maintained a surprisingly optimistic outlook on life, have never really gone along with him in this. They prefer instead the opinion of his eminent predecessor, Mencius, that people are intrinsically good, or Buddhist assurances that all living beings have latent within them the \"seeds\" or potential for moral and spiritual perfection.\n",
      "line is: In Xunzi's philosophical system as a whole, his bleak assessment of human nature is probably of less interest today than are the highly sanguine hopes he holds out for the improvement of that nature through education and moral training, and particularly through the civilizing influence of rites and music. And, it should be noted, like many other Chinese thinkers, he believes that the rulers of the nation—government, in other words—should play a crucial role in this process of educating and uplifting the population.\n",
      "line is: Our own society is very much alive with debate over how big or how little government ought to be, what its role should be in the lives of citizens, what the aim and content of education should be and through what channels it is best administered. The particular terms in which Xunzi's arguments are presented may in some cases seem odd or irrelevant to readers today. But many of the questions he addresses—how to ensure the sane use of language, to deploy military power effectively, to bring about order and safety in society—and those pertaining to education and the role of government mentioned earlier are surprisingly close to the concerns of our own age. Though the solutions he proposes may not strike us as entirely feasible, we can still learn much by observing the process of reasoning and analysis that leads to them. I am gratified that this translation of the more important of Xunzi's writings continues to be made available to readers.\n",
      "line is: What little is known of the life of Xunzi, or Master Xun, is culled from evidence in his own writings and from the brief biography of him written by the historian Sima Qian some hundred years or so after his death, which forms part of Chapter 74 of the _Shiji_. His personal name was Kuang,1 and he was a native of Zhao, a state situated in the central part of northern China. The date of his birth is unknown, but it was probably around 312 B.C., when his famous predecessor in the Confucian school, Mencius, was already well along in years. Nothing whatever is known of his early life; we hear of him first at the age of fifty, journeying to the court of the state of Qi to study and teach.\n",
      "line is: In 386 B.C. the Tians, who for generations had served as ministers to the royal family of Qi, usurped the throne of Qi and set themselves up as its new rulers. In order to consolidate their power and prove their fitness for so lofty a station, these new rulers of the Tian family, particularly the second major one, King Xuan (reigned 342–324 B.C.), encouraged scholars from other regions to come to the court of Qi by offering them honorary titles, stipends, living quarters, and complete leisure to pursue their studies and expound their various doctrines. Before long Qi had become the leading center of intellectual activity in China; Mencius visited the state during the reign of King Xuan and many other well known philosophers resided there permanently.\n",
      "line is: By the time Xunzi arrived in Qi, probably around 264 B.C., the ranks of government-supported scholars attracted by King Xuan and his successors had been thinned by death, and Xunzi was welcomed as an eminent elder and honored with titles and marks of esteem. Because of slanderous talk against him, however, he eventually left Qi and went south to the state of Chu, where the lord of Chunshen, nominally the prime minister of Chu but virtually its ruler, appointed him to the post of magistrate of Lanling, a region in southern Shandong. The Lord of Chunshen was assassinated by a court rival in 238 B.C. (the only date in Xunzi's life that can be fixed with certainty), and Xunzi lost his post as magistrate, but remained in Lanling the rest of his life and was buried there. The date of his death is unknown, so it is impossible to say whether he lived to witness the final unification of China under the First Emperor of the Qin, which was completed in 221 B.C.\n",
      "line is: The book which bears his name indicates that Xunzi visited the state of Qin, probably during the period 266–255 B.C., and that he debated military affairs in the presence of King Xiaocheng (reigned 265–245 B.C.) of his native state of Zhao. He undoubtedly had many disciples, and it is unfortunate for his reputation as a Confucian that the two most famous of them should have been Han Feizi, who became the leading exponent of the Legalist school, and Li Si, the statesman who assisted the First Emperor of the Qin in the unification of the empire, both men whose names are inseparably linked with the ridicule and persecution of Confucianism.\n",
      "line is: Xunzi's life, then, or what can be known of it, was a long and rather quiet one of teaching and study, with a minor excursion into local political administration. Later scholars have marveled that his worth, like that of Confucius and Mencius, should have been so little recognized by the political leaders of his time, and that he should have been allowed to live and die in relative obscurity. But the rulers of China, it seems, were not yet ready to give serious ear to the teachings of the Confucian school.\n",
      "line is: In Xunzi's day China was dominated by three powerful states: Qi in the east, Chu in the south, and Qin in the west. In the northwest and northeast four or five smaller states, among them Xunzi's native state of Zhao, maintained a precarious existence by allying themselves with one or another of the major powers. The old ruling house of Zhou, which once claimed sovereignty over all these so-called feudal states, had dwindled into utter insignificance, its territory shrunken to a tiny area in the center of China, its ancient ritual vessels and emblems of authority eyed with greed by its neighbors, and in 249 B.C. the dynasty finally passed out of existence altogether. For the first time in history, if traditional accounts are to be believed, China was left without even a nominal Son of Heaven, and no one knew where to turn his eyes in the hope of peace and unity. Known as the era of the Warring States, this period was an age of political instability and ferment, of incessant intrigue and strife.\n",
      "line is: Paradoxically, it was also an age of prosperity and cultural progress. Trade flourished, cities increased in size, men traveled freely from one state to another, and literacy and learning spread beyond the narrow confines of the ruling class. Even the art of warfare, though a melancholy index of progress, achieved a scale and complexity undreamed of in earlier days.\n",
      "line is: The rulers of the various states, roused by the fierce competition for survival, cast about for ways to improve the efficiency of their administration, win the support of their people, and enrich their domains. In response to their call, thinker after thinker came forward to offer his analysis of the problem and propound his solution. Return to the ways of antiquity, make better use of the land, lessen your desires, love the people, leave things alone!—advice swamped the rulers, and each set about assiduously applying that which took his fancy.\n",

      "line is: THE BIG NEWS STORY IN AUGUST 2011 WAS THE THREAT HURRICANE Irene posed to the way of life of New Yorkers. If events happened to fall just \"right,\" Manhattan and other low-lying regions might well be swamped, shutting down public transit systems, the New York Stock Exchange, food and water supply chains, and other niceties of urban life in New York City. Luckily, Irene ran out of steam before delivering such a life-changing blow, and the end result was a just bit worse than what would have been experienced from a very heavy summer storm. So the good people of Manhattan dodged a bullet, and the media hype beforehand simply amounted to a large dose of overreaction to the possible threats presented by Irene. But one day the bill really will come due, as it did in New Orleans with Hurricane Katrina in 2005, showing that overreaction and near-paranoiac prudence are two sides of the same coin.\n",
      "line is: Of course, believing that the sky is falling is a well-known defense mechanism when we're faced with a threat so far outside our comfort and knowledge zones that we can only run around like Chicken Little, hoping the threat goes away. Often it does. But not always. And it's those \"not always\" cases that don't just capture headlines, but also force us to confront the unpleasantries of existential threats to an accustomed way of life. This is no joke, either. X-events do occur. And they can wreak the kind of havoc and damage that many of us would like to believe only science-fiction writers and Hollywood film producers take seriously. But an X-event is not reality television; it's reality, period. Here are a couple of examples as prelude for the stories told in the pages of this book.\n",
      "line is: ABOUT 74,000 YEARS AGO, ON WHAT IS NOW THE ISLAND OF SUMATRA in Indonesia, the supervolcano Toba exploded with a force that cannot be compared with anything that has been seen on Earth since the time humans began to walk upright. Just for the sake of comparison, the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 had an explosive force of 150 megatons of TNT, which was ten thousand times greater than the atomic bomb that flattened Hiroshima. The Toba explosion is estimated to have been about one gigaton, over six times greater than Krakatoa and three thousand times greater than the energy produced by Mount St. Helens when it erupted in 1980.\n",
      "line is: At the time of the Toba event, Neanderthal man inhabited Earth, alongside Homo sapiens in Europe and Homo erectus and Homo floresiensis in Asia. The last Ice Age was then at its peak, with woolly mammoth and saber-toothed tiger on the menu for humans of the day. The volcano changed all that—overnight.\n",
      "line is: Alongside gigantic tsunami waves, the nearly three thousand cubic kilometers of dust and debris ejected into the atmosphere reduced the solar radiation so dramatically that plants received too little light to survive. The average temperature worldwide dropped to (note: not by, but to) 5 degrees (Fahrenheit), turning summer to winter and winter into a very deep freeze.\n",
      "line is: Today it's estimated that the total number of human survivors of this event was only a few thousand, mainly those living in small groups in Africa. This figure is the result of remarkable genetic detective work by scholars who examined DNA samples from that period. The researchers saw that the genetic samples from all over the world would have been very different if humans had been able to develop without the difficulties Toba created everywhere on the planet. Today's humans all stem from those hardy survivors. It was science journalist Ann Gibbons who suggested in 1993 that the Toba volcano was responsible for the near extinction of humankind, a hypothesis that was quickly taken up by researchers including Stanley Ambrose of the University of Illinois, who developed theories and dug up the data to back up Gibbons's idea.\n",
      "line is: But still \"almost\" only counts in horseshoes, and even a supervolcano like Toba couldn't in fact totally wipe humans from the face of the planet. It was a monumental catastrophe. No doubt about that. But it didn't send humankind to the graveyard of history. What could do that?\n",
      "line is: To get a handle on what type of event might end the tenure of Homo sapiens on Earth, we need go no farther than to the most popular wing in your local natural history museum. About sixty-five million years ago, a fireball six miles in diameter crashed into what today is the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico at a speed of about twenty miles per second. This \"near-earth object\" (NEO) created some of the same existential threats to life a supervolcano generates—fireballs, tidal waves, blast effects, and the like—but on a scale that dwarfs even the biggest supervolcano. To get a sense of what it would be like if such a behemoth struck a landmass today, here's a plausible scenario.\n",
      "line is: First, the local explosion would literally annihilate everything in the immediate area of the impact, generating a shock wave radiating outward for hundreds of miles that kills everything in its path. Gigantic fires would spread for as much as five hundred miles in all directions. And this is not to speak of the global firestorm produced by the huge amount of debris that would be sent into the atmosphere and come raining down all over the planet. The energy released from the strike would probably raise surface temperatures on Earth to levels seen inside a hot oven. It's important to note that debris in the atmosphere would block the sun's rays, producing a global freeze sometime after the impact and that massive shock waves traveling through the planet from the impact could well trigger volcanic activity as an aftereffect.\n",
      "line is: These effects are more than enough to have led to the demise of the dinosaurs, who dominated all life-forms on Earth for a whopping 170 million years. Their disappearance opened an eco-niche for some small, furry mammals about the size of a big rat that ultimately evolved into...today's humans. The one thing that's for certain, though, is that an object like this striking the planet today would stop civilization in its tracks. It's more than conceivable that every land animal larger than a cat would die. But who knows? After all, no dinosaur could lay in a supply of canned food, sacks of corn, or ensure a supply of potable water in a deep underground shelter. So some people might conceivably make it through even an event of this magnitude. But it doesn't seem to be the way to bet. Besides, who wants to live in a world in which the survivors would almost surely envy the dead?\n",
      "line is: In our current form, we humans have been in place for at most a few hundred thousand years. Of course, an asteroid like the one that struck the Yucatan itself occurs only every few hundred thousand years or more. But, then, what's a few hundred thousand years compared to the nearly two hundred million enjoyed by the dinosaurs before they exited center stage?\n",

      "line is: CHIEF INSPECTOR CHEN CAO of the Shanghai Police Bureau found himself standing in front of the gate to the Wuxi Cadre Recreation Center.\n",
      "line is: His vacation in the city of Wuxi was totally unexpected. Earlier that Sunday morning, Chen was in Zhenjiang, attending an intensive political seminar for emerging Party officials training for \"new responsibilities,\" when he got a phone call from Comrade Secretary Zhao, the former second secretary of the Central Party Discipline Committee. Though retired, Zhao remained one of the most influential figures in Beijing. Zhao was too busy to take a vacation arranged for him at the center in Wuxi, so he offered it to Chen instead.\n",
      "line is: Chen was in no position to decline such a well-meant offer, coming from the Forbidden City. So he immediately left the seminar at the Zhenjiang Party School, took a long-distance bus to Wuxi station, and then a taxi to the center.\n",
      "line is: He had heard a lot about the center, which was located in a scenic area of the city. It was something like a combination of a resort and a sanatorium, known for its special service to high-ranking cadres. There were strict regulations about the Party cadre rank required for admission, and Chen was nowhere close to that rank. Chen knew an exception was being made because of Zhao. Qiao Liangxing, the director of the center, was not around when Chen arrived. A front desk receptionist greeted Chen and led him to a white European-style villa, with tall marble columns in front, enclosed by an iron fence with gilded spikes and a shining stainless-steel gate. The villa stood alone on a tree-shaded hill, separate from other buildings. The receptionist showed Chen all due respect, as if the villa being allocated to him determined his status rather than the other way round. Without any other specific instructions from Qiao, however, all she could do was check Chen in with a detailed introduction to the center and its location: Yuantouzhu, or Turtle Head Park.\n",
      "line is: \"Our center gets its name from a huge rock projecting over the Tai Lake, like a turtle tossing its head above the water. The park was founded in 1918 and covers an area of five hundred hectares. It is a scenic peninsula on the northwest shore of the lake, surrounded by green hills and clear water; it is considered the best resort area in Wuxi. As for the center, at the south end of the peninsula, it was built in the early fifties for high-ranking cadres.\"\n",
      "line is: While listening to her introduction, Chen reflected on the way China took for granted the assumption that the Communist Party cadres, having conquered the country, deserved to enjoy all sorts of luxurious treatment.\n",
      "line is: \"Last but not the least, people staying here can easily walk into the park, but the tourists in the park may only look at the center through the gate. So enjoy your vacation here,\" the receptionist concluded, smiling, leaving the key as well as a park pass on a mahogany table in the hall before she left, closing the door carefully after her.\n",
      "line is: Chen moved to the front window. Looking out, he saw part of a curving driveway lined with shrubs and evergreen, and then further down the wooded hill, another driveway for someone else's villa. To the other side, there were rows of multistory buildings, with identically shaped balconies aligned like matchboxes, as those in a large new hotel. He didn't have a panoramic view of the center, but his villa was undoubtedly one reserved for top Party cadres.\n",
      "line is: It was a nice, large building consisting of nine rooms in all. He had no idea what to do with all those rooms as he walked upstairs and downstairs, examining one after another. He finally put his small suitcase in the master bedroom on the first floor, which commanded a fantastic lake view. Adjacent to the bedroom was a spacious living room, featuring a marble fireplace with a copper screen in an exquisite pattern, a black leather sectional sofa, and an LCD TV. One side of the room was a wall of tall windows overlooking Tai Lake.\n",
      "line is: Also on the first floor was a study with custom-made book shelves, some books, and a desk with a brand new laptop on it. The windows in the study were large, but looked out on the driveway and the hill beyond it.\n",
      "line is: Chen went back to the living room and started to pace about, stepping on and off an apricot Persian rug. His footsteps echoed through the entire building. Finally he decided to take a bath. He grabbed a cup and a bottle of Perrier from a silver tray on a corner table and settled himself in the master bathroom, which also had a scenic view.\n",

      "line is: The boy awakened in the night, although he had cultivated sufficient wariness to not move a muscle beneath the leopard- and yak-hide blankets. He scanned the dim sleeping cell without turning his head. A torch sizzled in its sconce high in the corner. Hoarfrost rimed the threshold of the doorway. Wind tore at the shuttered window as snow seeped in and dusted the sill.\n",
      "line is: A stranger sat at the foot of the bed. Killing cold did not appear to discomfort him. He wore a Brooks Brothers suit with a red carnation pinned to the left breast pocket. His short black hair gleamed like polished metal. Some might have considered him queerly handsome or supremely repellant, depending. He said, \"My name is Tom. Hello, son.\" Blandly unctuous, his skin and eyes and voice were odd. A plastic figurine, animated and life-sized, might have looked and sounded as Tom did. \"Sifu has terrorized you well. Your problem is the same problem inherent to all primates, which is, you are a primate.\"\n",
      "line is: \"Are you a friend of Sifu?\" The boy was afraid. Ruthless discipline disguised his fear. He pretended to be unaffected by the presence of a fellow westerner decked out for a garden party. Only assassin monks and child students were permitted inside the temple, for it was built atop a remote peak of the inner Himalayas, hundreds of miles from civilization and its devils, white and otherwise.\n",

Sadly, the Sultan marooned me here on this lee shore. Like him, I take my pleasures, great and small, as the opportunity arises.\"\n",
      "line is: \"I am sure you're a valuable servant. There must have been a misunderstanding.\"\n",
      "line is: \"No, my boy. He stranded me because it amuses him to do so. The universe and its design is often one of arbitrary horror. Let none of this disturb you overmuch. You won't remember our conversation.\"\n",
      "line is: The boy considered his options, and decided to say nothing.\n",
      "line is: Tom Mandibole smiled and his mouth articulated stiffly. \"I noticed your light as I walked by. A flame in the darkness is alluring.\"\n",
      "line is: \"I am abroad in the night with my servants. We come to smoke the northern lights, to rape the Wendigo, to melt igloos with streams of hot, bloody piss. To see and see.\"\n",

      "line is: Xenofeminism, or XF, can to some extent be viewed as a labour of bricolage, synthesizing cyberfeminism, posthumanism, accelerationism, neorationalism, materialist feminism, and so on, in an attempt to forge a project suited to contemporary political conditions. From this litany of influences xenofeminism assembles, not a hybrid politics – which would suggest the prior existence of some impossible, un-hybridized state – but a politics without 'the infection of purity'.1 In collecting, discarding, and revising existing perspectives – in stripping its myriad influences for parts – xenofeminism positions itself as a project for which the future remains open as a site of radical recomposition. This book is a first attempt at teasing out the underpinnings, arguments, and implications of 2015's xenofeminist manifesto in an extended form. However, it is important to note that this is just one interpretation of a polysemic project – a project riven with the unresolved tensions that come from collaboration across difference.\n",
      "line is: Each of the six members of Laboria Cuboniks – the xenofeminist working group of which I am a part – would likely emphasize different aspects of the manifesto, foregrounding some tendencies over others on account of our varied backgrounds, interests, and politics. The process of negotiating between our various feminist commitments has been one of the most satisfying and illuminating elements of our collective labour over the past three years. The manifesto remains a document that we are all happy to stand behind, and which we continue to incorporate into our individual practice – be that as musicians, artists, archaeologists, theorists, activists, coders, or poets. I would like to use this book to advance my __ own variation of XF, whilst continuing to acknowledge the divergent strands shaping the project as a whole. This is not _the_ book on xenofeminism, then, but rather _a_ book on xenofeminism.\n",
      "line is: I would like to start by briefly acknowledging some of the limits of this text, along with what I hope to achieve over the coming pages. _Xenofeminism_ is not a thoroughgoing review of existing academic literature, and nor is it a lengthy monograph on feminist theories of science and technology. Rather, it is a polemic or a provocation – one grounded in a self-consciously idiosyncratic selection of critical material.2 The references underpinning this text have been chosen not for their comprehensive articulation of the simultaneity of gender, technology, race, and sexualities, but for their suggestiveness and utility in terms of developing one particular strand of the XF project. The red thread uniting the chapters that follow represents what I consider to be one of the most compelling territories for any emerging xenofeminist position: reproduction, both biological and social. It is around this theme that the arguments of _Xenofeminism_ converge.\n",
      "line is: Chapter 1 offers a partial definition of XF, sketching out some of the broad concepts that will ground subsequent chapters. In particular, the manifesto's treatment of three key ideas – technomaterialism, anti-naturalism, and gender abolitionism – will be explored, in order to indicate where they might contribute to a xenofeminist politics of reproduction. In Chapter 2, I turn to XF futurities – and, more precisely, to the need to develop visions of the future that are based upon neither the prescription nor the proscription of human biological reproduction. Using contemporary environmental activism as a springboard, I point both to the mobilization of the Child as the privileged icon of a world to come, and to the anti-natalist tendencies implicit within recent accounts of a more sustainable future. Ultimately, I argue, we should look to foster a form of mutational politics – one that can be oriented towards practices of xeno-hospitality.\n",

      "line is: Adolf Hitler laughed. He threw his head back and his mouth flashed with gold inlays. The onetime manager of Berlin's grandest movie theatre told me that. Hitler was a movie fan and despite having his private theatre he liked to show himself amid Berlin's nightlife. Like many despots, he liked to show the world a human side.\n",
      "line is: Research (whether for history book, cookery books or fiction) is best sought from eye-witness evidence. Historians depend too readily on documents, and my experience is that paperwork is often manipulated by both official and private sources. Talking to participants and appraising their reliability is a test of the historian's skills. Paperwork is an essential backup for it provides a cross-reference and a context. Long periods in Austria and Germany – both East and West – enabled me to spend time with many people who had held important positions in the Third Reich. Among them I could count a dozen or more people who had spent time with Hitler face to face. The episodes you will read concerning Hitler's private train, and about the way the German gold reserves were hidden in the Kaiseroda Mine at Merkers are as authentic as I could make them. I was able to compare German and American eye-witness accounts with material from US archives in Washington DC. Most of what I used was declassified in response to my application. It works like this: you have someone with a high security classification seek out the material you need. That researcher goes to the top to ask for declassified status. It's a cumbersome business but it was the only way I could obtain the official documentation about the Kaiseroda Mine, which plays a large part in the story you are about to read.\n",
      "line is: I have only used professional researchers on rare occasions. Research is the fun side of the writing business; why pay someone else to do it? For the episodes in Los Angeles research was simpler and personal. Bill Jordan, a senior figure in LAPD intelligence department, has always been a universally respected policeman. After fighting his way across the Pacific for the Marine Corps, Bill became a familiar figure to Beverly Hills night people as he patrolled that jurisdiction on his Harley Davidson motor cycle. It was Bill who regularly stopped to talk with a young girl sitting on the sidewalk staring into space or sometimes sobbing. That was Marilyn Monroe and she was not the only local resident to owe Bill a debt of gratitude for his care and consideration. In one of those ironic twists that life provides, it was Bill who was the investigating officer for the Bobby Kennedy assassination.\n",
      "line is: Bill arranged for me to go out at night with the Los Angeles police cars. It wasn't like the movies and it wasn't like any of the books I had read, but that time spent with the LA police left me with lasting respect and admiration for these decent young Americans who did this dangerous sort of job night after night.\n",
      "line is: Despite its shortcomings – and I am coming to those – _XPD_ is one of my favourite books. It was also one of the most successful books I'd written up to that time. And behind the scenes it was one of the most fiercely criticized books too. Not long after publication, a member of the Churchill family wrote a letter of complaint to the publisher. And that wasn't all: the advertising poster alone – a photo of Hitler shaking hands with Winston Churchill – was enough to have one of the most amusing and energetic members of House of Lords withdraw all copies of _XPD_ from the hundreds of bookshops he controlled. There were cries of censorship and the order was reversed.\n",
      "line is: The furore caught me completely by surprise. I was in California and I found myself accused of planning a cunning advertising stunt from afar. I did not know whether to be flattered or insulted. I had always been a devout admirer of our wartime prime minister and I remain so. In any case it seemed a sad reflection on our times that these displays of frantic, if not to say antic, indignation were prompted by a story about Churchill attempting to negotiate peace. Could it really be defamatory to say that someone had tried to avoid the chronic misery and tens of millions of deaths of that terrible war?\n",
      "line is: In fact it was not the plot of _XPD_ that caused the fuss. Hitler and Churchill had been subjected to many worse fates at the hands of 'faction' writers. The critics of _XPD_ agreed on one point only; that my story was convincing. It was, they said angrily, written in such a way that readers would believe it. Did they want me to write a story that no one could believe?\n",
      "line is: This was the first spy story I'd written without the first-person narrative that had set Harry Palmer's style in _The IPCRESS File_. In _XPD_ I employed what I believe is called a 'cosmic' framework but which nowadays some writers call the 'omniscient' style. This is a no-holds-barred device; you can be an authorial nobody or inside everyone's head, you can move across the world without warning, delve far into the past and even address your reader with personal advice (don't be scared; I don't do that). In a first-person story, your hero is on every page whether you want him there or not. Cosmic formats diminish the importance of the central character. Perhaps I did not give him enough tender loving care, for Boyd Stuart is not an endearing hero. This may not have mattered except that I became more and more concerned with the character of Charles Stein.\n",
      "line is: I grew to like Charles Stein and he wrestled the book away from me. I have always avoided creating unredeemed villains. It's better, I feel, and more human, to show the best side of the worst characters. Some years before, I had written _Declarations of War_ , a book of war stories in which I polished men of lesser attraction and made them shine. It is a dangerous device but now I found myself doing exactly the same thing with the character of Charles Stein. Eventually it became the Charles Stein book and, looking back on it now, it is how I think of it, and that is why I like it. Hitler and Churchill have only walk-on parts. It is better that way.\n",
      "line is: 'The Second World War produced, in the end, one victor, the United States, one hero, Great Britain, one villain, Germany...'\n",
      "line is: In May 1979, only days after Britain's new Conservative government came to power, the yellow box that contains the daily report from MI6 to the Prime Minister was delivered to her by a deputy secretary in the Cabinet Office.

      "line is: Where do you _live_? Where do you feel _alive_? Where do you feel safe, peaceful, hopeful, and supported? Where can you explore your hobbies, think, learn, and love? If your home is just a temporary holding pen where you leave your things during the day instead of a beautiful space that makes you feel safe and calm every time you walk in the door, something is wrong. Your home is more than a place where your possessions are — it is a place where your body can recharge, where your passions can be fulfilled, where you can safely explore yourself and your desires, and where your soul can rest, be inspired, and soar. Home is about satisfying our basic animal needs: eating, sleeping, seeking shelter. But it is also about achieving transcendence on earth through our other needs, the ones that are the basis of our humanity: beauty, love, and creativity.\n",
      "line is: For the past ten years, I have been redesigning homes with one purpose: to assist the people who live within to create the kind of space where they can flourish instead of just exist.

      "line is: 1. As you open the front door, the glow of warm light beckons you inside. You set your bag on a handmade table near the door and slip off your shoes, placing them and your coat in the neatly organized hall closet. The serene, beautifully appointed living room draws you in. You sink deeply in to a soft, comfortable chair and drape a finely knit, cozy throw over your legs. The sky, visible through a large, clear window, is soothing. A feeling of calm and revitalization washes over you. You close your eyes and enjoy the quiet luxury of a catnap before preparing a light supper. You're home.\n",

You stumble into the dark hallway as you grope for the light switch. The bulb blows out, leaving you in a gray wash of dim light. The hall closet is crammed to capacity with coats, sweaters, and things you haven't seen in years. You throw your coat on a living room chair instead. The seat cushion is faded and worn. The air in the room is stale. A feeling of stress and irritation washes over you. You're home. You look around at the clutter and decide to put your coat back on and grab a bite to eat at the local diner.\n",
      "line is: Where you live and what you live with are an extension of who you are: your living quarters are a physical manifestation of your emotional wants and needs, a mirror of your thoughts, dreams, hopes, wishes, and issues. And it isn't just about the four walls that surround you: it's about the energy with which you fill your space. I want you to consider the possibility that your home is an extension and a physical representation of who you are — and who you have been. Your space holds all your unfinished emotional business and baggage; the interior design of your home is a mirror of the interior design of you.\n",
      "line is: Thoughts have power. Whether you create your home intentionally or unintentionally, your thoughts and desires have been projected onto the objects that you have purchased, inherited, and collected, and when you see those things, you are consciously or unconsciously reminded of the situations in which they were acquired.\n",
      "line is: Objects acquired via love make us feel loved. Objects acquired via greed make us feel ashamed. By ridding ourselves of the physical manifestation of negative patterns and surrounding ourselves with positive manifestations of our best selves, we can move forward in an environment designed to help us be our very best.\n",
      "line is: Think about an apartment building full of identically shaped apartments that are all the same size, with the same number of rooms and windows. If you were to walk into every one of the identical units in the building, no two would look the same. Each would be colored by its inhabitants. 10A's residents are a fortysomething power couple; their apartment has bright red walls and smells of takeout Thai. 10B's young parents have a place full of toys, games, and dust. 10C has only one tenant, an artist in her sixties who listens to Beethoven to drown out the sound of the children next door and has decorated her apartment with plush white carpets and a baby grand piano.\n",
      "line is: Even though the bare bones of the apartments looked identical when the Realtor sold the units, each unit has been transformed radically by the lives and spirits of the people who live there. Each one has different sights, sounds, smells, and feelings, and each one makes you feel different upon entering. 10A is lively. 10B is chaotic. 10C is serene. The colors, the smells, the sounds, and the entire energy of each space have been transformed by each inhabitant. If you have ever gotten a new roommate, moved in with someone, or had a child — even gotten a pet! — you know that living creatures carry with them a set of habits that color their environments. _Every home tells its own story._\n",
