      "[\"juicing has changed my life beyond all recognition. i know it's a cliché when people say this or that changed their life, but i can say with total confidence that without juicing my life would be radically different from what it is today.\", \"before i got into juicing i used to smoke 40–60 cigarettes a day; i liked my drink (as they say); i was more than partial to the odd bit of junk(ie) food, and, as a result, i was also fat. on top of that i had severe asthma to the point where i had to use both the blue and brown inhalers and was having 10–16 puffs a day on them. i also developed eczema, mild acne, bad hay fever, and very, very severe psoriasis. in short, i wasn't exactly in the best of health and my energy levels were often right through the floor.\", \"i am now in the fortunate position of being free from smoking, drinking, and junk food. my asthma has vanished, my eczema and acne have gone, my psoriasis has cleared by over 95%, and i am no longer overweight. in fact, on the health front i'm one happy camper!\", 'i am now also lucky to be able to help people who find themselves in a similar position to the one i was in. since the launch of my first book, _slim for life: freedom from the diet trap_ , i have been blessed with tens of thousands of letters and e-mails from all over the world from people who have made incredible changes to their health and lives.', 'my previous book, _turbo-charge your life in 14 days_ , exceeded all expectations when it reached number three on amazon.co.uk (harry potter took the first two spots). it was written about in virtually every magazine as well as being discussed on tv and radio to the extent that several radio hosts followed the program themselves and reported on their progress to the listeners.', 'the success of that book led to some of the most amazing letters about life-changing experiences i have ever had—from people who not only lost an amazing amount of weight but, more importantly, who found that their lives had changed for good, and not just for the two weeks. they had set out to do a quick 14-day plan to lose some weight and get a little healthier, only to find that their eating habits and lifestyle changed for good.', 'this was exactly what i had in mind with the 7 lbs in 7 days program, but the impact this book has had throughout the world has taken everyone by surprise. it hit the number one slot of _all_ books on amazon.co.uk and even knocked _the da vinci code_ off the top spot. it has been translated into many languages and it was even reported that sarah jessica parker, drew barrymore, and jennifer aniston have all done what is now being called the \"juice master diet.\" i have no idea if they actually did the plan, but many celebrities have known about the weight-loss and health power of freshly extracted juice for years. the \"juice master diet\" has been talked about on television and radio in many parts of the world and even many in the medical profession now recommend the program. in january each year tens of thousands of people from all over the world do the \"juice master diet\" at exactly the same time in what is called the \"world\\'s biggest juice detox.\" we all jump on social networking sites and people share their incredible transformations. you simply won\\'t believe how stupidly good you will look and feel in such a short time. i realize you should under-promise and over-deliver, but there are now well over a million copies of this book out in the world, and i have personally read and seen the truly breathtaking results. this is why i have 100% confidence in the program, both as a healthy rapid weight loss tool and, perhaps more importantly, as a health program. it\\'s also why i am excited that it has finally come to the good ole us of a. the uk now has the undesirable title of being the \"fattest nation in europe,\" but here in the us you are now one of the world leaders in this subject. not only is obesity a major issue here, but i have never seen so many commercials for so many medical drugs on tv as here in the states. americans now take so many drugs for so many \"different\" illnesses, including obesity, that if you picked up the average joe walking down the street and shook him he would rattle! this simply cannot be right and cannot be the way for 21st-century living.', 'i realize that the title of this book— _7 lbs in 7 days_ —may have lured many people into looking for some kind of \"quick fix,\" but i know that if you read the book and follow all of the instructions, it will be a catalyst to a _lifelong_ change.', 'i have already been rapped for using the word \"diet\" on the front cover of this book, but that\\'s the publisher—not me! i did argue my case over and over again: after all, the first chapter in my first book, _slim for life_ , is all about why diets don\\'t work, but here i am with a book that contains a title with the word \"diet\" in it. i suppose that in order to get your message to the people who need it most you sometimes have to compromise along the way, and the title of this book is one of those compromises.', 'having said that, after thinking about it, and after seeing the long-term results from all over the world, i believe it has only done good. because of the title the real message has reached people who would perhaps otherwise never have been touched by it. the way i look at it is this: if this book gets to those people who are \"serial dieters,\" then that\\'s just great. i know from personal experience that jumping from one diet to another is not a bundle of fun, and if i can do anything to break anyone\\'s diet merry-go-round then i will—no matter what method is required (well, within reason!). my aim is for this to be the last book with the word \"diet\" on the cover that they will ever feel the need to buy. and throughout the book you will discover that i never once refer to the 7 lbs in 7 days program as a \"diet\"; i always use the words \"plan\" or \"program.\"', 'if you are a serial dieter yourself and you feel that you have been misled into thinking this is a 7-day \"diet\" and that you will do it and then be able to go back to your old way of eating and drinking, then i make no apologies. i\\'m up for the challenge. all you need to do is open your mind, read the book, and do the program. i can guarantee you won\\'t be able to give up your new juicy lifestyle after the seven days. yes, you\\'ll eat again—you cannot live on juice alone, and who on earth would want to?—but you will not have the same mental urges to go back to your old lifestyle. what blows people away the most is how their cravings completely change toward the end of the 7 days. far from yearning for refined sugar and refined fat foods, the only thing on your mind will be big salads, fresh vegetables, and lean proteins. hard to believe now, but i\\'ve been doing this for many years and i have seen hundreds of thousands of people do the plan and find that their cravings for junk just disappear. at the end of just 7 days you will be juiced on both a physical _and_ mental level.']\n",

      "['as is the case in any scientific field, advances in neuroanatomy have been enabled by the improvement in the tools available to researchers. these tools have undergone revolutionary changes in the past 100 years. when one of the first nobel prizes in the field of neuroscience was awarded to camillo golgi and santiago ramon y cajal in 1906, the main research technique available to neuroscientists was the visual or optical microscopic examination of stained nerve cells. when numerous forms of scanning electron microscopy were introduced in the 20th century, they were immediately applied to the field of neuroanatomy, which greatly benefited from this technological advancement.', 'among the tools and techniques available for neuroanatomy research, the imaging techniques that allow the researcher to perform in vivo studies of the human brain play especially significant roles in the advancement of the field. these imaging techniques include ct scanning using x-rays, nuclear imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (pet) and single-photon emission computed tomography (spect), and mri. recent advances in mri, especially in the area of ultra-high-field (uhf) mri such as 7.0 tesla (t), have attracted significant attention in the field of brain imaging for neuroscience, as well as in clinical research. several physical and engineering problems related to uhf mri are yet to be resolved. for example, due to the increased radio frequency (rf) in uhf mri, image distortions are formed as a consequence of rf field inhomogeneities. nevertheless, with the drastically improved contrast and resolution offered by these images obtained with 7.0 t mri, previously unseen images of numerous fine structures in the human brain have been revealed in vivo. these structures include the subthalamic nucleus, the substantia nigra and their surroundings in the midbrain region, as well as various abnormalities found in associated regions. since these images began to reveal numerous strikingly fine structural details in the human brain in vivo, many experts in the field of neuroscience started pondering on how high resolution mri would affect the fields of modern medicine and neuroscience research as a whole.', 'interest in the advances in the field of neuroanatomy is no longer restricted to anatomists. in order to understand the functional concepts of the nervous system, comprehending its structural organization is essential. therefore, gaining an in-depth understanding of the subtle details of brain structure became important to enable lucid communication amongst clinicians, scientists, and other specialists working in the field of neuroscience and clinical medicine. the wealth of information provided by modern imaging techniques makes it imperative for the interpreter of the images to be thoroughly familiar with the minutiae of brain anatomy. specialized knowledge of brain anatomy is a prerequisite; this means that the interpreters should possess knowledge of the gross anatomy of the brain and also be completely familiar with brain sections in various planes. currently, it is not adequate to describe brain structures vaguely with terms such as the \"fronto-parietal region\" or \"basal ganglia.\" it is also necessary to precisely define and describe the specific gyrus or nucleus involved in pathological processes.', 'new neuroimaging applications are reported almost on a daily basis. previously, the determination of the location, extent, and exact position of an intracranial space-occupying lesion was considered to be significant. presently, the goal of clinical studies has extended in such a manner that the definition of the non-neoplastic lesions, i.e., cerebral hemorrhage, edema, and infarction, as well as demyelinating diseases and various neurodegenerative processes, is also considered to be crucial.', 'let us consider the following analogy. when a new generation of giant cosmic telescopes became available to astronomers, these new tools not only offered the advantage of increased resolution and clearer and more informative images, but also enabled them to gain a new level of understanding of the universe. similarly, with improvements in the field strength and resolution in mr imaging, it became possible to acquire images with unprecedented resolution and contrast. in addition to the obvious signal-to-noise improvement predicted by the laws of physics, variations in mri tissue physical parameters, such as t1 and t2 relaxation times or their combinations were observed. from another front, considerable advances in the imaging of human cadavers using cryomacrotome with increased sophistication and improved techniques have allowed us to obtain cadaver images of unprecedented resolution and contrast with markedly conserved brain structures. with these high-resolution images obtained with uhf mri and recent advances in cryomacrotome technology, we were of the opinion that the construction of a new brain atlas would be an important and timely contribution to the medical and neuroscience community.', 'therefore, in this book, we prepared a set of ultra-high resolution brain images obtained from a cadaver using a cryomacrotome and reconstructed partner images (sagittal and coronal), together with corresponding in vivo ultra-high resolution human brain images obtained with 7.0 t mri. thus, we were able to obtain a complete set of images for the entire brain atlas with axial, sagittal, and coronal images of the cadaver and corresponding set of 7.0 t mri images of the in vivo human brain. in this book, we applied a reference system that is applicable to both cadaver gross anatomy and mri anatomy. in addition, a cartesian axis system is defined on the midpoint of central intercommissural distance, with coordinates expressed in mm and ± along axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. this system will enable us to standardize the sectional planes and the levels at which the slices were obtained in any brain that may be encountered during clinical practice.', 'we have also applied a reference-adjusted unit designed to enable the reader, i.e., the mri user, to predict the structure from any plane, regardless of the absolute size of the image of the brain obtained with clinical mri. we expect our image numbering system to contribute to the establishment of a clinicopathologic mapping system of the human brain through massive global feedback of related information. eventually, we hope that this book will serve as a roadmap in both clinical and neuroscience research in the years to come.', 'this atlas was made possible through the generous support of dr. gil-ya lee, the chair woman of the gil foundation, whose vision was instrumental in establishing and supporting the neuroscience research institute (nri). all staff members of the nri have enjoyed and appreciated the opportunity to work at one of the most advanced research facilities in the world. thanks are also due to dr. chul-ock lee, a former adviser to the nri, whose enthusiasm, commitment, dedication and support made the nri what it is now. we also like to thanks siemens as well as their technical staffs who helped us make the 7.0 t system work and function. without their help it could have not been possible to obtain the fine images seen in this book.', 'the authors and collaborators are indebted to a large number of individuals, both within and outside the nri, who greatly contributed to this project. due to space limitations, it is impossible to list them all, but we are grateful to all of them. the following individuals deserve our special gratitude.', 'first, we would like to express our gratitude and respect to the cadaver donor and his family for granting permission to use his body for medical research and education, and to the volunteer, who allowed us to procure his mri images.', 'we would like to thank all members of the nri who worked on this project, including the students who helped create the brain maps and improve their appearance: so-hee lee, b.a., myung-ho in, m.sc., nam-bum kim, m.sc., sung-tae kim, m.sc., chan-a park, b.a., jung-hwan kim, b.a., seok-il hwang, b.a., sung-yeon park, b.a. and hyon lee, md., keum-hwan ryu, b.a, without their efforts, this project could not be accomplished.']\n",

      "['of the greek poets of the seventh century bc we know almost nothing and none of their poems has come down to us entire. archilochos was a professional soldier from the aegean island of paros; sappho a member of a distinguished family on lesbos, an island off the coast of asia minor; and aikman was a slave and choirmaster in the lydian city sardis before he emigrated, or was sold to, sparta, where he wrote the two hymns, to artemis and hera, which assure him a place all his own in literature.', 'archilochos is the second poet of the west. before him the archpoet homer had written the two poems of europe; never again would one imagination find the power to move two epics to completion and perfection. the clear minds of these archaic, island-dwelling greeks survive in a few details only, fragment by fragment, a temple, a statue of apollo with a poem engraved down the thighs, generous vases with designs abstract and geometric.', 'they decorated their houses and ships like florentines and japanese; they wrote poems like englishmen of the court of henry, elizabeth, and james. they dressed like samurai; all was bronze, terra cotta, painted marble, dyed wool, and banquets. of the arcadian greece of winckelmann and walter pater they were as ignorant as we of the ebony cities of yoruba and benin. the scholar poets of the renaissance, ambrogio poliziano and christopher marlowe, whose vision of antiquity we have inherited, would have rejected as indecorous this seventh-century world half oriental, half viking. archilochos was both poet and mercenary. as a poet he was both satirist and lyricist. iambic verse is his invention. he wrote the first beast fable known to us. he wrote marching songs, love lyrics of frail tenderness, elegies. but most of all he was what meleager calls him, \"a thistle with graceful leaves.\" there is a tradition that wasps hover around his grave. to the ancients, both greek and roman, he was the satirist.', 'we have what grammarians quote to illustrate a point of dialect or interesting use of the subjunctive; we have brief quotations by admiring critics; and we have papyrus fragments, scrap paper from the households of alexandria, with which third-class mummies were wrapped and stuffed. all else is lost. horace and catullus, like all cultivated readers, had archilochos complete in their libraries.', 'even in the tattered version we have of archilochos, some three hundred fragments and about forty paraphrases and indirect quotations in the budé edition (1958, revised 1968) of professors lasserre and bonnard,* a good half of them beyond conjecture as to context, so ragged the papyrus, or brief (\"grape,\" \"curled wool,\" \"short sword\") the extraordinary form of his mind is discernible. not all poets can be so broken and still compel attention.', 'like the brutal but gallant _landsknecht_ urs graf, both artist and soldier, or the _condottiere_ , poet, military engineer, and courtly amorist sigismondo malatesto of rimini, archilochos )(kept his \"two services\" in an unlikely harmony. ares did not complain that this ashspear fighter wrote poems, and the muses have heard everything and did not mind that their horsetail-helmeted servant sometimes spoke with the vocabulary of a paratrooper sergeant, though the high-minded spartans banned archilochos\\'s poems for their mockery of uncritical bravery. and the people of his native paros made it clear, when they honored him with a monument, that they thought him a great poet in spite of his nettle tongue.', 'apollo in an ancient conceit read archilochos with delight and was of the opinion that his poems would last as long as mankind. \"hasten on, wayfarer,\" archilochos\\'s tomb bore for inscription, \"lest you stir up the hornets.\" leonidas the epigrammatist imagined the muses hopelessly in love with archilochos, and delian apollo to boot, for how else account for such melody, such verve? quintilian admired his richness of blood, meaning liveliness, we suppose, and his abundance of muscle. plutarch in his essay on music places archilochos among the innovators of metric, and horace, imitating archilochos, congratulated himself on bringing greek numbers into italy. pindar called him archilochos the scold. writers as different as milton, who mentions him in the _areopagitica_ as trying the patience of the defenders of the freedom of speech, and wyndham lewis, who spits like a cat at his reputation, took his satiric talent for granted without really knowing what he wrote. hipponax alone among the archaic poets, we are told, has as sharpened a stylus as archilochos, and hipponax is remembered for a grim little couplet:', 'woman is twice a pleasure to man,  \\nthe wedding night and her funeral.', 'though he is said to have written with venom and, according to gaitylikos, splashed helicon with gore, we have no evidence of anything so caustic. we have to take antiquity\\'s word for it, or assume that the panhellenes were far touchier than we about satire. certainly their sense of honor was of an iron strictness. to mock, a greek proverb goes, is to thumb through archilochos. \"the longer your letters, the better,\" aristophanes complimented a friend, \"like the poems of archilochos.\"', 'it is precisely the tone of archilochos that gives us a problem with no solution. in 1974 a new poem of archilochos\\'s was published in r. merkelbach\\'s and m.l. west\\'s _zeitschrift für papyrologie und epigraphik_. it was discovered on a papyrus mummy wrapping, identified and edited (ten years\\' work it was) by anton fackelmann, translated here as fragment 18. its tone would be aesthetically difficult even if we were surer of its meaning. our fortune in having it at all is immense and vies in importance with the utterly new dimension of lyric poetry which it gives to our tentative and sketchy knowledge of the dawn of european literature. is it a comic poem, a raucous anecdote with a hilarious punch line? is it frankly an erotic poem (peter green has waggishly titled it \"the last tango in paros\").* there is nothing in greek literature like its last three stanzas. we can understand the robust bawdy of aristophanes and herondas, the vivid eroticism of sappho and anakreon, but these lines of archilochos–sung in barracks, on the march, in village squares, at singing contests?–are they satire or salacity, private or public? i would like to believe that it is a satiric collision of a love song and a biological fact, the kind of comedy you get if juliet on her balcony had dislodged a flowerpot in her ecstasy and beaned romeo below.', 'of the man himself we know that he was born on paros in the cyclades in the first half of the seventh century bc. pausanias knew a tradition that makes him the descendant of one tellis, or telesikles, who was distinguished enough to have figured in polygnotos\\'s frescoes at delphi, where he was shown with kleoboia, who introduced the eleusinian mysteries into thasos, an island that owes much to archilochos\\'s family. a byzantine encyclopedia credits his father with founding a town on thasos, \"an island crowned with forests and lying in the sea like the backbone of an ass,\" as archilochos describes it in a poem.']\n",

(unless you're still freeloading in the store.* or you got it as a gift, in which case, why don't you just move to canada if you like handouts so much?)\", \"but as i was saying, me and my friends wrote this book to help people.* it's who we are. we're givers. some of you may be wondering what makes people like us qualified to write a self-help book. i'd like nothing more than to get into all that, but as it turns out there's some litigation pending at the moment and on the advice of charlie's uncle jack i'm not at liberty to talk about certain matters related to how this book came to be. needless to say, though, we are _totally_ somebodies and we're totally qualified to be book writers and world-renowned fixers of other people's broken pathetic lives. otherwise, _ergo quo ipso,_ you wouldn't be holding this thing in your hands, would you? book executives don't spend butt-tons of cash churning out a bunch of crap by complete assholes nobody gives a shit about. that's a tv executive's job.\", \"since i can't talk about how the book came to be, let me break the title down for you. first off, the more observant among you may have noticed that we promise seven secrets in the title, yet the book contains only five sections. the reason for this is simple, but it's a secret. in fact it's the first secret of the book. oh man, you would think it was hilarious if i told you. so ironic, yet so perfect. it's just so _us,_ y'know? anyway, the less questions you ask about the number seven in the title the better, because we're not going to tell you, and it's definitely not because people just love the number seven for no rational reason.* besides, five sections is a _lot_ less work than seven, and one of the secrets to finishing what you start is to not start so many things. that's a bonus secret for you, right up front. i think it's fair to say that we don't skimp on the secrets around here.\", 'the \"awakening\" part is pretty straightforward. most numbnuts are content to sleepwalk their way through life, and the only way they\\'re ever going to amount to anything more than human leeches on american resources is if someone blasts \\'em in the face with a white-hot load of truth.* we are those someones, this book is our white-hot load, the words inside are the truth, and the eyes you read them with are your face. you might want to have a paper towel handy, because you\\'re about to have truth all over it.', 'dennis said we should put \"highly effective\" in there because it\\'s 2015 and regular old \"effective\" doesn\\'t cut it anymore. the \"four-hour\" thing was frank\\'s idea. he said something about how people want something substantial, and that means it has to take a while, but not so long that they have to spend their whole lives doing it. it boils down to this: everyone has four hours, but if changing their entire life from top to bottom takes any longer than that, they\\'ll lose interest.', \"the part about the giant was all me. it's a subtle reference to my physique. it's no secret that i've been bulking up lately, and not just on the glamour muscles. i've been blasting my core like a madman* as an inspiration for all the flabby slobs out there who wouldn't know a deltoid from an altoid. if that's you, don't worry, we go over the exact difference in the book.* by the time you finish reading this thing you'll be super ripped, just like me. it's all part of the service.\", \"all right, you feeling introducted?

      "[\"the world's population will reach seven billion this year. but you don't need to visit delhi, india (population 22 million), or china (home to a fifth of the world's people) to grasp the consequences. when i return to jackson county, oregon, where i was born, the green fields where i used to cut hay, dig onions, and harvest pears are gone. they have been replaced by subdivisions and big-box stores. this is hardly a surprise given that the population of jackson county has more than tripled in my lifetime. when i see the rapid development going on in my hometown, i can't help but wonder what the future holds for the rest of the world.\", 'this month we begin exploring that future with a series of stories about population. environment editor robert kunzig starts by sketching out a natural history of population. the issues associated with population growth seem endless: poverty, food and water supply, world health, climate change, deforestation, fertility rates, and more.', 'kunzig writes, \"there may be some comfort in knowing that people have long been alarmed about population.\" some of the first papers on demography were written in the 17th century. it\\'s more than 300 years later, and we are still grappling with the outcome of people v. planet. we look forward to exploring the topic with you.', \"robert kunzig is national geographic's senior editor for the environment.\", 'one day in delft in the fall of 1677, antoni van leeuwenhoek, a cloth merchant who is said to have been the long-haired model for two paintings by johannes vermeer—\"the astronomer\" and \"the geographer\"—abruptly stopped what he was doing with his wife and rushed to his worktable. cloth was leeuwenhoek\\'s business but microscopy his passion. he\\'d had five children already by his first wife (though four had died in infancy), and fatherhood was not on his mind. \"before six beats of the pulse had intervened,\" as he later wrote to the royal society of london, leeuwenhoek was examining his perishable sample through a tiny magnifying glass. its lens, no bigger than a small raindrop, magnified objects hundreds of times. leeuwenhoek had made it himself; nobody else had one so powerful. the learned men in london were still trying to verify leeuwenhoek\\'s earlier claims that unseen \"animalcules\" lived by the millions in a single drop of lake water and even in french wine. now he had something more delicate to report: human semen contained animalcules too. \"sometimes more than a thousand,\" he wrote, \"in an amount of material the size of a grain of sand.\" pressing the glass to his eye like a jeweler, leeuwenhoek watched his own animalcules swim about, lashing their long tails. one imagines sunlight falling through leaded windows on a face lost in contemplation, as in the vermeers. one feels for his wife.', \"leeuwenhoek became a bit obsessed after that. though his tiny peephole gave him privileged access to a never-before-seen microscopic universe, he spent an enormous amount of time looking at spermatozoa, as they're now called. oddly enough, it was the milt he squeezed from a cod one day that inspired him to estimate, almost casually, just how many people might live on earth.\", \"nobody then really had any idea; there were few censuses. leeuwenhoek started with an estimate that around a million people lived in holland. using maps and a little spherical geometry, he calculated that the inhabited land area of the planet was 13,385 times as large as holland. it was hard to imagine the whole planet being as densely peopled as holland, which seemed crowded even then. thus, leeuwenhoek concluded triumphantly, there couldn't be more than 13.385 billion people on earth—a small number indeed compared with the 150 billion sperm cells of a single codfish! this cheerful little calculation, writes population biologist joel cohen in his book how many people can the earth support?, may have been the first attempt to give a quantitative answer to a question that has become far more pressing now than it was in the 17th century. most answers these days are far from cheerful.\", \"historians now estimate that in leeuwenhoek's day there were only half a billion or so humans on earth. after rising very slowly for millennia, the number was just starting to take off. a century and a half later, when another scientist reported the discovery of human egg cells, the world's population had doubled to more than a billion. a century after that, around 1930, it had doubled again to two billion. the acceleration since then has been astounding. before the 20th century, no human had lived through a doubling of the human population, but there are people alive today who have seen it triple. sometime in late 2011, according to the un population division, there will be seven billion of us.\", 'and the explosion, though it is slowing, is far from over. not only are people living longer, but so many women across the world are now in their children than she would have had a generation ago. by 2050 the total number could reach 10.5 billion, or it could stop at eight billion—the difference is about one child per woman. un demographers consider the middle road their best estimate: they now project that the population may reach nine billion before 2050—in 2045. the eventual tally will depend on the choices individual couples make when they engage in that most intimate of human acts, the one leeuwenhoek interrupted so carelessly for the sake of science.', \"with the population still growing by about 80 million each year, it's hard not to be alarmed. right now on earth, water tables are falling, soil is eroding, glaciers are melting, and fish stocks are vanishing. close to a billion people go hungry each day. decades from now, there will likely be two billion more mouths to feed, mostly in poor countries. there will be billions more people wanting and deserving to boost themselves out of poverty. if they follow the path blazed by wealthy countries—clearing forests, burning coal and oil, freely scattering fertilizers and pesticides—they too will be stepping hard on the planet's natural resources. how exactly is this going to work?\", 'there may be some comfort in knowing that people have long been alarmed about population. from the beginning, says french demographer hervé le bras, demography has been steeped in talk of the apocalypse. some of the field\\'s founding papers were written just a few years after leeuwenhoek\\'s discovery by sir william petty, a founder of the royal society. he estimated that world population would double six times by the last judgment, which was expected in about 2,000 years. at that point it would exceed 20 billion people—more, petty thought, than the planet could feed. \"and then, according to the prediction of the scriptures, there must be wars, and great slaughter, &c.,\" he wrote.']\n",

manhattan\\'s gold coast—the upper east side rectangle formed by fifth and park avenues between fifty-ninth and ninety-sixth streets—the man is hunched, halting, and stout, and the woman, stately and sylphic-thin. \"pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall,\" says the book of proverbs. the former plutocrat saul philip steinberg and his third wife, gayfryd, seem to embody that adage.', 'it is clear as they maneuver their way to their table at sette mezzo that saul steinberg still suffers from the effects of a devastating stroke he had a decade earlier. so gayfryd gently guides him, holding one of his arms, the left one, the one that seems partly paralyzed. and as they pass their fellow diners, many of them members of the same super-wealthy clique the steinbergs once led, friendly greetings are murmured aloud, while silently prayers are said—and not necessarily for steinberg\\'s health. rather, they tend toward sentiments like, \"there but for the grace of god go i.\"', \"saul steinberg's stroke was followed by catastrophic financial reverses that upended his life at the turn of the millennium. steinberg hit bottom on may 11, 2000, when his troubles drove him from his home of twenty-eight years, a sumptuous duplex apartment, previously owned by john d. rockefeller jr., atop 740 park avenue. steinberg bought the place for $225,000 after rockefeller's widow died in 1971, and sold it twenty-nine years later for approximately $30 million. it may have been the best investment in a life full of them. yet it was not cause for celebration. rather, it was a harrowing admission of defeat. saul, friends say, is getting over the bouts of spontaneous sobbing he suffered after the stroke. but gayfryd still cries over the hand fate has dealt them.\", \"once, steinberg was the boy wonder of wall street. in 1961, fresh out of wharton, the baby-faced business phenomenon opened a computer-leasing company that became one of the highest fliers in that decade's go-go market. trading on the inflated value of his flash-in-the-pan technology stock, steinberg swooped in on unsuspecting companies and bought large positions in their stocks. the first time he did it, in 1968, he conquered reliance, a 151-year-old philadelphia insurance company. not yet thirty, he used its millions in cash reserves to reinvent himself as a swashbuckling corporate pirate who would soon attempt more takeovers of such iconic american companies as chemical bank, walt disney, and the new york times.\", 'after reliance, steinberg rarely succeeded, but that may have been beside the point. he usually raked in a fortune, either by selling when his moves goosed stock prices or by getting paid what became known, post-saul, as greenmail.1 corporations paid greenmail to foil takeovers—buying back their shares at a substantial premium over market value to make the likes of steinberg go away. quaker state paid him $10 million, penn central, $8 million. then he turned on disney. the house that walt built paid him $60 million to go away, but in the process they also replaced their chief executive with a new one, michael eisner, who turned the vulnerable studio into a media colossus. no one thanked saul steinberg.', \"in 1981, forty-two-year-old steinberg and his family controlled a $100 million fortune, according to the forbes 400 list of the richest americans. by 1983, that stake had doubled. and in 1984, the magazine doubled its estimate again, to $400 million. his holding company, reliance group, was worth $3.7 billion. steinberg's personal net worth peaked in september 1987 at about $660 million, then dropped by a third in a stock market crash. in the early 1990s, reliance stock was still sinking and it owed $650 million in junk-bond debt, but _forbes_ pegged saul's personal fortune at $330 million, plumped up by the sale of reliance's stakes in united air lines (for $100 million) and days inn ($765 million).\", 'steinberg always used his money as if trying to live up to a boast he\\'d made after raiding reliance. \"like the rockefellers, i\\'ll own the world,\" he\\'d said. entertaining in imperial style, cultivating a fearsome public reputation, and a private one that blended charm with intelligence, while giving millions—both his own and reliance\\'s—to museums, libraries, and universities, he was deemed lordly. but that wasn\\'t enough for him. a sign in his office read, in both english and hebrew, \"on the eighth day, saul rested.\"', \"perhaps the hubris finally did him in. after his 1995 stroke, steinberg fell off the forbes 400 list of america's richest—and his life fell apart. he was even sued by his own mother. but the worst part was losing his home at 740 park avenue, for it was the apartment of his dreams. he'd bought it from the richest man in the world, the son of the greatest capitalist of the industrial age, the same son who'd overcome the family's rotten, bloody,

(think mini-food processors, handheld mixers, and emulsion blenders.) these won't be able to do the same work load as their larger counterparts, but they work in a pinch if you're cooking for two.\", 'the problems of cooking in a small kitchen are multiplied during the summer. when it is hot outside, it is even hotter inside, especially in an apartment that may not have central air conditioning, or even very good ventilation. under those circumstances, turning on the oven pretty much amounts to turning the entire apartment into a sauna.', \"• tons of ingredients—okay, that's not always true, but if i do use a lot of ingredients, it's mostly spices. usually the ingredient list is small and manageable.\", '• lots of different components to a single dish that must be separately prepared—which would take up too much space and create too many dirty dishes.', \"• processed, puréed, or foods made extremely small by using something other than a sharp knife. but you will need a seriously sharp knife. believe me, it's worth the extra money, and a good knife lasts forever.\"]\n",

      "['on a sunny, leaf-strewn fall afternoon a couple of years ago i visited the philadelphia museum of art, which is one of the finest art museums in the united states. i was captivated by their fine array of classic and modern masterpieces, lingered over their wonderful collection of impressionist paintings, and even paused outside the building for a few minutes at the top of their long flight of steps leading up to the entrance, where rocky balboa once stood triumphant in the iconic scene from the movie. i barely managed to restrain myself from raising my hands like the fictional prizefighter had done.', 'one of the areas of the museum where i spent a little extra time that day was in their impressive american art galleries. i won\\'t soon forget the experience of entering one of the rooms in that area and finding my eyes immediately drawn to a large and powerful painting depicting mary\\'s visit from the angel gabriel in which he announced that she would be the mother of jesus. i hadn\\'t previously known of this painting, but the warm, bright golden tones, the look of shy astonishment on mary\\'s face, and the unusually creative way the angel had been rendered all combined to take my breath away. this moment of biblical history portrayed in the painting is commonly known as \"the annunciation,\" and as i bent forward to read the information plaque affixed to the wall nearby i discovered that this was the title of the work, and that its creator was henry ossawa tanner.', 'when i returned to my hotel room i searched the internet for information about tanner and found that he was an african-american painter from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries who specialized in paintings of biblical subject matter and was himself a committed christian. the more i researched, the more fascinated i became by the man and his work, and the more i was inspired by his vision of the biblical stories.', \"it's my hope that this book can have the same effect on you as that moment of discovery in the museum had on me—of introducing you to some of the great artistic achievements of fellow believers, from the very beginnings of the church to our present time. i'd love for you to meet some of these fascinating people and experience some of their work so that you might be inspired, entertained, and challenged by their art, music, writing, and films.\", \"it is not possible to do full justice to the works discussed in this book within the constraints imposed by page count. these short introductions are more like trailers for a movie rather than the movie itself. think of this book, if you will, as a fistful of invitations—invitations to begin your own personal exploration of art, music, literature, and films that you've never experienced before, or as an opportunity to revisit some old favorites. let this volume be a departure point for your own journey of exploration.\", 'as a culture we are often enamored with the latest thing. we \"consume\" art, music, books, and films and then pass on quickly to whatever is the next big thing, often neglecting the rich heritage of the past. i think this is especially true for christians; many of us are unaware of how many of the great masterpieces—works universally admired—were created by people who share our faith commitment. we have a heritage in the arts of which we can justifiably be proud.', 'what this book offers is a selection of seventy-five creative expressions of faith that range across time, genres, and nationalities. this is most emphatically not a list of the absolute best or greatest works, nor does it imply any ranking system. instead, it attempts to represent the breadth and depth of what christians have accomplished in the arts, and is an intentionally quirky mix of the widely known and the mostly unknown. i could easily offer an alternative collection of seventy-five works that would be just as valid as these. frankly, it was a painful process to limit myself to the works represented in these pages. many of my favorites got left out in my desire to express something of the stylistic variety of creative work done by believers.', 'my guidelines for the selection of the works featured in this volume were pretty simple: (1) they had to be works that are universally esteemed for their craftsmanship and creativity, not only admired by christians but also by those outside the faith; (2) they had to be works that stand up well to repeated exposure, the kind of art that can be visited again and again, because there is always something new to discover; (3) they had to be works that speak to people across time, cultures, national boundaries, and denominational divides.', \"the artists whose works are represented here come from a variety of traditions—protestant, catholic, orthodox, and sometimes a little bit unorthodox. they didn't always express their beliefs with carefully constructed theology. they were not theologians, but through their works they give us fresh insights into scripture and into the key teachings and experiences of faith.\", \"though the works of these artists deserve the highest regard, their lives were not always so praiseworthy. as you read their stories you'll discover that many of them lived messy and imperfect lives, and didn't always live out their convictions very well. they were fellow strugglers more than role models, and their honesty about their own personal battles makes them that much more accessible to us today.\", 'these artists were not interested in creating propaganda or some sort of advertisement for christianity but simply in recording the truth as they saw and felt it. through the years, though, many people have ultimately found their witness to faith more compelling and convincing than even the best of sermons or theological treatises. art can reach places in the human heart that reasoned argument can never penetrate.']\n",

got home at 2:15 a.m. that thursday with a new tattoo: a two-word obscenity in blue block letters between the knuckles of the middle finger of his right hand. earlier in the night, at a cocktail lounge, he'd thrust that stiff digit at another customer who didn't speak english and who was visiting from some third-world backwater where the meaning of the offending gesture evidently wasn't known in spite of countless hollywood films in which numerous cinema idols had flashed it. in fact, the ignorant foreigner seemed to mistake the raised finger for some kind of friendly hello and reacted by nodding repeatedly and smiling. earl was frustrated directly out of the cocktail lounge and into a nearby tattoo parlor, where he resisted the advice of the needle artist and, at the age of fifty-eight, acquired his first body decoration.\", \"when earl strode through the front entrance of the exclusive pendleton, into the lobby, the night concierge, norman fixxer, greeted him by name. norman sat on a stool behind the reception counter to the left, a book open in front of him, looking like a ventriloquist's dummy: eyes wide and blue and glassy, pronounced marionette lines like scars in his face, head cocked at an odd angle. in a tailored black suit and a crisp white shirt and a black bow tie, with a fussily arranged white pocket handkerchief blossoming from the breast pocket of his coat, norman was overdressed by the standards of the two other concierges who worked the earlier shifts.\", \"earl blandon didn't like norman. he didn't trust him. the concierge tried too hard. he was excessively polite. earl didn't trust polite people who tried too hard. they always proved to be hiding something. sometimes they hid the fact that they were fbi agents, pretending instead to be lobbyists with a suitcase full of cash and a deep respect for the power of a senator. earl didn't suspect that norman fixxer was an fbi agent in disguise, but the concierge was for damn sure something more than what he pretended to be.\", \"earl acknowledged norman's greeting with only a scowl. he wanted to raise his newly lettered middle finger, but he restrained himself. offending a concierge was a bad idea. your mail might go missing. the suit you expected back from the dry cleaner by wednesday evening might be delivered to your apartment a week later. with food stains. although flashing the finger at norman would be satisfying, a full apology would require doubling the usual christmas gratuity.\", 'consequently, earl scowled across the marble-floored lobby, his embellished finger curled tightly into his fist. he went through the inner door that norman buzzed open for him and into the communal hallway, where he turned left and, licking his lips at the prospect of a nightcap, proceeded to the north elevator.', 'his third-floor apartment was at the top of the building. he did not have a city view, only windows on the courtyard, and seven other apartments shared that level, but his unit was sufficiently well-positioned to justify calling it his penthouse, especially because it was in the prestigious pendleton. earl once owned a five-acre estate with a seventeen-room manor house. he liquidated it and other assets to pay the ruinous fees of the blood-sucking, snake-hearted, lying-bastard, may-they-all-rot-in-hell defense attorneys.', 'as the elevator doors slid shut and as the car began to rise, earl surveyed the hand-painted mural that covered the walls above the white wainscoting and extended across the ceiling: bluebirds soaring joyously through a sky in which the clouds were golden with sunlight. sometimes, like now, the beauty of the scene and the joy of the birds seemed forced, aggravatingly insistent, so that earl wanted to get a can of spray paint and obliterate the entire panorama.', \"he might have vandalized it if there hadn't been security cameras in the hallways and in the elevator. but the homeowners' association would only restore it and make him pay for the work. large sums of money no longer came to him in suitcases, in valises, in fat manila envelopes, in grocery bags, in doughnut-shop boxes, or taped to the bodies of high-priced call girls who arrived naked under leather trench coats. these days, this former senator so frequently felt the urge to deface so many things that he needed to strive to control himself lest he vandalize his way into the poorhouse.\", \"he closed his eyes to shut out the schmaltzy scene of sun-washed bluebirds. when the air temperature abruptly dropped perhaps twenty degrees in an instant, as the car passed the second floor, earl's eyes startled open, and he turned in bewilderment when he saw that the mural no longer surrounded him. the security camera was missing. the white wainscoting had vanished, too. no inlaid marble underfoot. in the stainless-steel ceiling, circles of opaque material shed blue light. the walls, doors, and floor were all brushed stainless steel.\", \"before earl blandon's martini-marinated brain could fully absorb and accept the elevator's transformation, the car stopped ascending—and plummeted. his stomach seemed to rise, then to sink. he stumbled sideways, clutched the handrail, and managed to remain on his feet.\"]\n",

      "[\"with over 25 years' experience working with babies and children, my passion has led me to become a successful newborn sleep, routine and breastfeeding expert, which has allowed me to help parents get a great start with their newborns. i have helped parents all over the united kingdom and internationally. i decided to write this book to offer anxious, tired parents an alternative to sleepless nights and inflexible, 'one-size-fits-all' routines.\", \"many mothers i've helped over the years have remarked that it's a shame their little bundle of joy doesn't come with a user manual. (that, and an air valve for easy winding!) clearly this is the result of a lack of planning on the part of the design department! the first three months with your baby, although exciting, can be a very emotional and exhausting time. this has not always been helped by health professionals, experts and other books on baby care offering advice that babies should be fed 'whenever they show signs of hunger' and considering it normal for a baby to wake several times a night. a few weeks of continual, frequent night waking can leave even the most resilient parent frazzled. it's quite likely that you are reading this book because you, like so many other parents, are sleep-deprived and unable to decipher your new arrival. perhaps your baby is having feeding or digestive issues. or maybe she is unable to self-settle to sleep and wakes frequently during naps and at night.\", \"in today's baby world, there are generally two main schools of thought: the baby-led, feed on demand, co-sleeping approach versus the strict routine, controlled crying method. i have been teaching my routine for 20 years now and, with my hands-on experience, i believe there is an urgent need for a more balanced, 'best of both worlds' approach. the _7pm to 7am sleeping baby routine_ focuses on your baby's digestion and an understanding of how to meet her every need. a baby's digestive comfort has an impact on how settled and relaxed she is, her ability to feed properly, sleep, stay awake and generally be happy in herself. my routine also teaches positive associations, for example sucking for food instead of for comfort or as an aid to falling asleep; self-settling instead of being rocked and cuddled to sleep; and learning the difference between night and day early on. my routine also encourages skin-on-skin cuddle naps as well as stimulating play.\", \"the _7pm to 7am sleeping baby routine_ can be followed from birth or introduced at a later stage if you need help after weeks, or even months, of night waking. for those of you reading this book before the birth, or in the first couple of weeks afterwards, you will be able to start as you mean to go on – it's much easier to establish good feeding and sleeping habits now, at the start of your baby's life, than to break bad habits later on. and, by following the sleeping baby routine, you could have your baby sleeping through the night for up to 12 hours as early as 6–8 weeks of age. how much of my routine you follow is up to you but, even if you apply just some of my '12 steps for 12 hours' sleep' (here), it will have a positive impact and you will have a greater understanding of your new baby.\", \"my maternal instinct has driven my passion and my routine is based on over 25 years of experience helping hundreds of babies sleep at night, mothers successfully breastfeed and families adapt to a routine within an already busy family life. my routine has a newborn's needs, well-being and digestive comfort at the heart of it and the results speak for themselves: babies on the sleeping baby routine are happy and thriving, sleep through the night from an early age, and quickly learn the difference between night and day.\", 'my method is based on decades of experience and, as you will see, at times goes against general government advice. throughout the book i will explain my methodology and offer compromises as well as outlining the current government recommendations so you can make your own decision on what is best for your child.', \"we all live our lives by routine. many of us get up in the morning, have breakfast, go to work, and eat lunch and dinner at around the same time each day. routines help us to feel secure, and it's no different for infants. for most babies who are fed on demand – the baby-led approach – the lack of structure means that they are essentially sorting out their own routine. as a result, your baby may well decide to sleep all day and be awake through the night, sleep while she is feeding or want to feed when you want her to sleep.\", 'on a routine your baby will demand feeding every 3–4 hours, and often go longer between feeds during the day if left to her own accord. however, you will want to take advantage of these longer periods between feeds during the night so often you will need to wake your baby for her daytime feeds. in the first 6–8 weeks, if you feed your baby until she is naturally full, as my routine suggests, she will not need or want to be fed more frequently. you are not leaving your baby hungry, crying or waiting for feeds. if your baby is hungry, she is fed. you are merely making sure your baby feeds well and is wind-free at each feed period, encouraging some structured awake time to allow for digestion and to teach her the difference between night and day.', \"the advice to feed your baby whenever she shows signs of hunger – 'on demand' – means you could be reading your baby incorrectly as babies show signs of hunger, known as 'rooting', when they are hungry, but also when they are uncomfortable with wind and when they are tired. interestingly, the advice for twins and multiple births is to routine feed your babies, even when these babies are often born at a much lower birth weight. so why would a routine be so controversial for a single baby? i believe the lack of nhs funding has had an impact on the advice given to new parents these days. it used to be that a mother stayed in hospital and was taught baby care and breast-feeding skills and now, with inconsistent advice, mothers are barely taught how to latch their babies to the breast and told to let their baby feed whenever she wants. with a routine that works the proof is in the results: a thriving baby who is gaining weight, sleeps well and has happy, calm playtime.\", \"in my view, the first stage of parenting is to teach your baby to sleep at night. i am not totally against feeding babies 'on demand', but if you feed your baby until she is full, wind her regularly and structure awake time at each day feed, rather than giving short, frequent feeds of 5–10 minutes, she will _demand_ her meals every 3–4 hours and fall into a natural routine.\", \"the idea is to encourage, not to enforce, a routine. babies are individuals with their own personalities and capabilities so don't expect your baby to act like a robot that can be programmed. the sleeping baby routine is based on structured days and baby-led nights offering a balanced approach with no controlled crying. your baby will naturally sleep through the night at her own pace and this will become a habit that stays with her throughout childhood. sometimes the routine will go like clockwork; sometimes it won't. when this happens, don't despair – i will show you options to adjust the routine accordingly, and always remember that tomorrow is another day! you can use my routine either as a broad guideline for a satisfied, happy baby or as a recommendation to be followed closely, so that your baby sleeps through the night much more quickly than is generally thought possible.\"]\n",

      "[\"juicing has changed my life beyond all recognition. i know it's a cliché when people say this or that changed their life, but i can say with total confidence that without juicing my life would be radically different from what it is today.\", \"before i got into juicing i used to smoke 40–60 cigarettes a day; i liked my drink (as they say); i was more than partial to the odd bit of junk(ie) food, and, as a result, i was also fat. on top of that i had severe asthma to the point where i had to use both the blue and brown inhalers and was having 10–16 puffs a day on them. i also developed eczema, mild acne, bad hay fever, and very, very severe psoriasis. in short, i wasn't exactly in the best of health and my energy levels were often right through the floor.\", \"i am now in the fortunate position of being free from smoking, drinking, and junk food. my asthma has vanished, my eczema and acne have gone, my psoriasis has cleared by over 95%, and i am no longer overweight. in fact, on the health front i'm one happy camper!\", 'i am now also lucky to be able to help people who find themselves in a similar position to the one i was in. since the launch of my first book, _slim for life: freedom from the diet trap_ , i have been blessed with tens of thousands of letters and e-mails from all over the world from people who have made incredible changes to their health and lives.', 'my previous book, _turbo-charge your life in 14 days_ , exceeded all expectations when it reached number three on amazon.co.uk (harry potter took the first two spots). it was written about in virtually every magazine as well as being discussed on tv and radio to the extent that several radio hosts followed the program themselves and reported on their progress to the listeners.', 'the success of that book led to some of the most amazing letters about life-changing experiences i have ever had—from people who not only lost an amazing amount of weight but, more importantly, who found that their lives had changed for good, and not just for the two weeks. they had set out to do a quick 14-day plan to lose some weight and get a little healthier, only to find that their eating habits and lifestyle changed for good.', 'this was exactly what i had in mind with the 7 lbs in 7 days program, but the impact this book has had throughout the world has taken everyone by surprise. it hit the number one slot of _all_ books on amazon.co.uk and even knocked _the da vinci code_ off the top spot. it has been translated into many languages and it was even reported that sarah jessica parker, drew barrymore, and jennifer aniston have all done what is now being called the \"juice master diet.\" i have no idea if they actually did the plan, but many celebrities have known about the weight-loss and health power of freshly extracted juice for years. the \"juice master diet\" has been talked about on television and radio in many parts of the world and even many in the medical profession now recommend the program. in january each year tens of thousands of people from all over the world do the \"juice master diet\" at exactly the same time in what is called the \"world\\'s biggest juice detox.\" we all jump on social networking sites and people share their incredible transformations. you simply won\\'t believe how stupidly good you will look and feel in such a short time. i realize you should under-promise and over-deliver, but there are now well over a million copies of this book out in the world, and i have personally read and seen the truly breathtaking results. this is why i have 100% confidence in the program, both as a healthy rapid weight loss tool and, perhaps more importantly, as a health program. it\\'s also why i am excited that it has finally come to the good ole us of a. the uk now has the undesirable title of being the \"fattest nation in europe,\" but here in the us you are now one of the world leaders in this subject. not only is obesity a major issue here, but i have never seen so many commercials for so many medical drugs on tv as here in the states. americans now take so many drugs for so many \"different\" illnesses, including obesity, that if you picked up the average joe walking down the street and shook him he would rattle! this simply cannot be right and cannot be the way for 21st-century living.', 'i realize that the title of this book— _7 lbs in 7 days_ —may have lured many people into looking for some kind of \"quick fix,\" but i know that if you read the book and follow all of the instructions, it will be a catalyst to a _lifelong_ change.', 'i have already been rapped for using the word \"diet\" on the front cover of this book, but that\\'s the publisher—not me! i did argue my case over and over again: after all, the first chapter in my first book, _slim for life_ , is all about why diets don\\'t work, but here i am with a book that contains a title with the word \"diet\" in it. i suppose that in order to get your message to the people who need it most you sometimes have to compromise along the way, and the title of this book is one of those compromises.', 'having said that, after thinking about it, and after seeing the long-term results from all over the world, i believe it has only done good. because of the title the real message has reached people who would perhaps otherwise never have been touched by it. the way i look at it is this: if this book gets to those people who are \"serial dieters,\" then that\\'s just great. i know from personal experience that jumping from one diet to another is not a bundle of fun, and if i can do anything to break anyone\\'s diet merry-go-round then i will—no matter what method is required (well, within reason!). my aim is for this to be the last book with the word \"diet\" on the cover that they will ever feel the need to buy. and throughout the book you will discover that i never once refer to the 7 lbs in 7 days program as a \"diet\"; i always use the words \"plan\" or \"program.\"', 'if you are a serial dieter yourself and you feel that you have been misled into thinking this is a 7-day \"diet\" and that you will do it and then be able to go back to your old way of eating and drinking, then i make no apologies. i\\'m up for the challenge. all you need to do is open your mind, read the book, and do the program. i can guarantee you won\\'t be able to give up your new juicy lifestyle after the seven days. yes, you\\'ll eat again—you cannot live on juice alone, and who on earth would want to?—but you will not have the same mental urges to go back to your old lifestyle. what blows people away the most is how their cravings completely change toward the end of the 7 days. far from yearning for refined sugar and refined fat foods, the only thing on your mind will be big salads, fresh vegetables, and lean proteins. hard to believe now, but i\\'ve been doing this for many years and i have seen hundreds of thousands of people do the plan and find that their cravings for junk just disappear. at the end of just 7 days you will be juiced on both a physical _and_ mental level.']\n",

      "['[8.1] when tullius, after receiving the guardianship of the kingdom and expelling the faction of the marcii, thought he was now in secure possession of the sovereignty, he honoured king tarquinius, as if he had but recently died of his wounds, with a very costly funeral, an imposing monument, and the other usual honours. and from that time, as guardian of the royal children, he took under his protection and care both their private fortunes and the public interests of the commonwealth. [2] the patricians, however, were not pleased with these proceedings, but felt indignation and resentment, being unwilling that tullius should build up a kind of royal power for himself without either a decree of the senate or the other formalities prescribed by law. and the most powerful of them met together frequently and discussed with one another means of putting an end to his illegal rule; and they resolved that in the first time tullius should assemble them in the senate-house they would compel him to lay aside the rods and the other symbols of royalty, and that after this was done they would appoint the magistrates called interreges and through them choose a man to rule the state in accordance with the laws. [3] while they were making these plans, tullius, becoming aware of their purpose, applied himself to flattering and courting the poorer citizens, and hopes of retaining the sovereignty through them; and having called an assembly of the people, he brought the children forward to the tribunal and delivered a speech somewhat as follows:', '[9.1] \"i find myself under great obligation, citizens, to take care of these infant children. for tarquinius, their grandfather, received me when i was fatherless and without a country, and brought me up, holding me in no respect inferior to his own children. he also gave me one of his two daughters in marriage, and during the whole course of his life continued to honour and love me, as you also know, with the same affection as if i had been his own son. and after that treacherous attack was made upon him he entrusted me with the guardianship of these children in case he should suffer the fate of all mortals. [2] who, therefore, will think me pious towards the gods or just towards men if i abandon and betray the orphans to with i owe so great a debt of gratitude? but, to the best of my ability, i shall neither betray the trust reposed in me nor yet abandon the children in their forlorn condition. you too ought in justice to remember the benefits their grandfather conferred upon the commonwealth in reducing to your obedience so many cities of the latins, your rivals for the sovereignty, in making all the tyrrhenians, the most powerful of your neighbours, your subjects, and in forcing the sabine nation to submit to you — all of which he effected at the cost of many great dangers. [3] as long, therefore, as he himself was living, it became you to give him thanks for the benefits you had received from him; and now that he is dead, it becomes you to make a grateful return to his posterity, and not to bury the remembrance of their deeds together with the persons of your benefactors. consider, therefore, that you have all jointly been left guardians of these little children, and confirm to them the sovereignty which their grandfather left them. for they would not receive so great an advantage from my guardianship, which is that of one man only, as from the joint assistance of you all. [4] i have been compelled to say these things because i have perceived that some persons are conspiring against them and desire to hand the sovereignty over the others. i ask you, romans, also to call to mind the struggles i have undergone in the interest of your supremacy — struggles neither inconsiderable nor few, which i need not relate to you who are familiar with them — and to repay to these little children the gratitude you owe me in return. for it has not been with a view to securing a sovereignty of my own — of which, if that had been my aim, i was as worthy as anyone — but in order to aid the family of tarquinius, that i have chosen to direct public affairs. [5] and i entreat you as a suppliant not to abandon these orphans, who are now, indeed, only in danger of losing the sovereignty, but, if this first attempt of their enemies succeeds, will also be expelled from the city. but on this subject i need say no more to you, since you both know what is required and will perform your duty.', '[6] \"hear from me now the benefits i myself have arranged to confer upon you and the reasons that induced me to summon this assembly. those among you who already have debts which through poverty they are unable to discharge, i am eager to help, since they are citizens and have undergone many hardships in the service of their country; hence, in order that these men who have securely established the common liberty may not be deprived of their own, i am giving them from my own means enough to pay their debts. [7] and those who shall hereafter borrow i will not permit to be haled to prison on account of their debts, but will make a law that no one shall lend money on the security of the persons of free men; for i hold that it is enough for the lenders to possess the property of those who contracted the debts. and in order to lighten for the future the burden also of the war taxes you pay to the public treasury, by which the poor are oppressed and obliged to borrow, i will order all the citizens to give in a valuation of their property and everyone to pay his share of the taxes according to that valuation, as i learn is done in the greatest and best governed cities; for i regard it as both just and advantageous to the public that those who possess much should pay much in taxes and those who have little should pay little. [8] i also believe that the public lands, which you have obtained by your arms and now enjoy, should not, as at present, be held by those who are the most shameless, whether they got them by favour or acquired them by purchase, but by those among you who have no allotment of land, to the end that you, being free men, may not be serfs to others or cultivate others\\' lands instead of your own; for a noble spirit cannot dwell in the breasts of men who are in want of the necessaries of daily life. [9] but, above all these things, i have determined to make the government fair and impartial and justice the same for all and towards all. for some have reached that degree of presumption that they take upon themselves to maltreat the common people and do not look upon the poor among you as being even free men. to the end, therefore, that the more powerful may both receive justice from and do justice to their inferior impartially, i will establish such laws as shall prevent violence and preserve justice, and i myself will never cease to take thought for the equality of all the citizens.\"', '[10.1] while he was thus speaking there was much praise from the assembly, some commending him for his loyalty and justice to his benefactors, others for his humanity and generosity to the poor, and still others for his moderation and democratic spirit towards those of humbler station; but all loved and admired him for being a lawful and just ruler. [2] the assembly having been dismissed, during the following days he ordered lists to be made of all the debtors who were unable to keep their pledges, with the amount each owed and the names of the creditors; and when this list had been delivered to him, he commanded tables to be placed in the forum and in the presence of all the citizens counted out to the lenders the amount of the debts. [3] having finished with this, he published a royal edict commanding that all those who were enjoying the use of the public lands and holding them for their own should quit possession within a certain specified time, and that those citizens who had no allotments of land should give in their names to him. he also drew up laws, in some cases renewing old laws that had been introduced by romulus and numa pompilius and had fallen into abeyance, and establishing others himself. [4] while he was pursuing these measures, the patricians were growing indignant as they saw the power of the senate being overthrown, and they proceeded to a plan of action which was no longer the same as before, but the opposite. [5] for whereas at first they had determined to deprive him of his illegal power, to appoint interreges, and through them to choose one who should hold the office legally, they now thought they ought to acquiesce in the existing state of affairs and not to interfere at all. for it occurred to them that, if the senate attempted to place a man of its own choosing at the head of affairs, the people, when they came to give their votes, would oppose him; whereas, if they should leave the choice of the king to the people, all the curiae would elect tullius and the result would be that he would seem to hold the office legally. they thought it better, therefore, to permit him to continue in the possession of the sovereignty by stealth and by deceiving the citizens rather than after persuading them and receiving it openly. [6] but none of their calculations availed them aught, so artfully did tullius outmanoeuvre them and get possession of the royal power against their will. for having long before caused a report to be spread through the city that the patricians were plotting against him, he came into the forum meanly dressed and with a dejected countenance, accompanied by his mother ocrisia, tanaquil, the wife of tarquinius, and all the royal family. and when great crowds flocked together at so unexpected a sight, he called an assembly, and ascending the tribunal, addressed them much as follows:', '[11.1] \"it is no longer the children of tarquinius alone whom i see in danger of suffering some injury at the hands of their enemies, but i am already coming to fear for my own life, lest i receive a bitter requital for my justice. for the patricians are plotting against me and i have received information that some of them are conspiring to kill me, not because they can charge me with any crime, great or trivial, but because they resent the benefits i have conferred and am prepared to confer upon the people and feel that they are being treated unjustly. [2] the money-lenders, for their part, feel aggrieved because i did not permit the poor among you to be haled to prison by them because of their debts and to be deprived of their liberty. and those who misappropriate and hold what belongs to the state, finding themselves obliged to give up the land which you acquired with your blood, are as angry as if they were being deprived of their inheritances instead of merely restoring what belongs to others. those, again, who have been exempt from war taxes resent being compelled to give in a valuation of their property and to pay taxes in property to those valuations. but the general complaint of them all is that they will have to accustom themselves to live according to written laws and impartially dispense justice to you and receive it from you, instead of abusing the poor, as they now do, as if they were so many purchased slaves. [3] and making common cause of these complaints, they have taken counsel and sworn to recall the exiles and to restore the kingdom to marcius\\' sons, against whom you passed a vote forbidding them the use of fire and water for having assassinated tarquinius, your king, a worthy man and a lover of his country, and, after they had committed such an act of pollution, for having failed to appear for their trial and thus condemned themselves to exile. and if i had not received early information of these designs, they would, with the assistance of a foreign force, have brought back the exiles into the city in the dead of night. [4] you all know, of course, what would have been the consequence of this, even without my mentioning it — that the marcii, with the support of the patricians, after getting control of affairs without any trouble, would first have seized me, as the guardian of the royal family and as the person who had pronounced sentence against them, and after that would have destroyed these children and all the other kinsmen and friends of tarquinius; and, as they have much of the savage and the tyrant in their nature, they would have treated our wives, mothers and daughters and all the female sex like slaves. [5] if, therefore, it is your pleasure also, citizens, to recall the assassins and make them kings, to banish the sons of your benefactors and to deprive them of the kingdom their grandfather left them, we shall submit to our fate. but we all, together with our wives and children, make supplication to you by all the gods and lesser divinities who watch over the lives of men that, in return for the many benefits tarquinius, the grandfather of these children, never ceased to confer upon you, and in return for the many services i myself, as far as i have been able, have done you, you will grant us this single boon — to declare your own sentiments. [6] for if you have come to believe that any others are more worthy than we of this honour, the children, with all the other relations of tarquinius, shall withdraw, leaving the city to you. as for me, i shall take a more generous resolution in my own case for i have already lived long enough both for virtue and for glory, and if i am disappointed of your goodwill, which i have preferred to every other good thing, i could never bring myself to live in disgrace among any other people. take the rods, then, and give them to the patricians, if you wish; i shall not trouble you with my presence.\"', '[12.1] while he was speaking these words and seemed about to leave the tribunal, they all raised a tremendous clamour, and mingling tears with their entreaties, besought him to remain and to retain control of affairs, fearing no one. thereupon some of his partisans, who had stationed themselves in different parts of the forum, following his instructions, cried out, \"make him king,\" and demanded that the curiae should be called together and a vote taken; and after these had set the example, the whole populace was promptly of the same opinion. [2] tullius, seeing this, no longer let the occasion slip, but told them that he felt very grateful to them for remembering his services; and after promising to confer even more benefits if they should make him king, he appointed a day for the election, at which he ordered everybody to be present including those from the country. [3] when the people had assembled he called the curiae and took the vote of each curia separately. and upon being judged worthy of the kingship by all the curiae, he then accepted it from the populace, telling the senate to go hang; for he did not ask that body to ratify the decision of the people, as it was accustomed to do. after coming to the sovereignty in this manner, he introduced many reforms in the civil administration and also carried on a great and memorable war against the tyrrhenians. but i shall first give an account of his administrative reforms.', '[13.1] immediately upon receiving the sovereignty he divided the public lands among those of the romans who served others for hire. next he caused both the laws relating to private contracts and those concerning torts to be ratified by the curiae; these laws were about fifty in number, of which i need not make any mention at present. [2] he also added two hills to the city, those called the viminal and the esquiline, each of which has the size of a fairly large city. these he divided among such of the romans as had no homes of their own, so that they might build houses there; and he himself fixed his habitation there, in the best part of the esquiline hill. [3] this king was the last who enlarged the circuit of the city, by adding these two hills to the other five, after he had first consulted the auspices, as the law directed, and performed the other religious rites. farther than this the building of the city has not yet progressed, since the gods, they say, have not permitted it; but all the inhabited places round it, which are many and large, are unprotected and without walls, and very easy to be taken by any enemies who may come. [4] if anyone wishes to estimate the size of rome by looking at these suburbs he will necessarily be misled for want of a definite clue by which to determine up to what point it is still the city and where it ceases to be the city; so closely is the city connected with the country, giving the beholder the impression of a city stretching out indefinitely. [5] but if one should wish to measure rome by the wall, which, though hard to be discovered by reason of the buildings that surround it in many places, yet preserves in several parts of it some traces of its ancient structure, and to compare it with the circuit of the city of athens, the circuit of rome would not seem to him very much larger than the other. but for an account of the extent and beauty of the city of rome, as it existed in my day, another occasion will be more suitable.', '[14.1] after tullius had surrounded the seven hills with one wall, he divided the city into four regions, which he named after the hills, calling the first the palatine, the second the suburan, the third the colline, and the fourth the esquiline region; and by this means he made the city contain four tribes, whereas it previously had consisted of but three. [2] and he ordered that the citizens inhabiting each of the four regions should, like persons living in villages, neither take up another abode nor be enrolled elsewhere; and the levies of troops, the collection of taxes for military purposes, and the other services which every citizen was bound to offer to the commonwealth, he no longer based upon the three national tribes, as aforetime, but upon the four local tribes established by himself. and over each region he appointed commanders, like heads of tribes or villages, whom he ordered to know what house each man lived in. [3] after this he commanded that there should be erected in every street by the inhabitants of the neighbourhood chapels to heroes whose statues stood in front of the houses, and he made a law that sacrifices should be performed to them every year, each family contributing a honey-cake. he directed also that the persons attending and assisting those who performed the sacrifices at these shrines on behalf of the neighbourhood should not be free men, but slaves, the ministry of servants being looked upon as pleasing to the heroes. [4] this festival the romans still continued to celebrate even in my day in the most solemn and sumptuous manner a few days after the saturnalia, calling it the compitalia, after the streets; for compiti, is their name for streets. and they still observe the ancient custom in connexion with those sacrifices, propitiating the heroes by the ministry of their servants, and during these days removing every badge of their servitude, in order that the slaves, being softened by this instance of humanity, which has something great and solemn about it, may make themselves more agreeable to their masters and be less sensible of the severity of their condition.', '[15.1] tullius also divided the country as a whole into twenty-six parts, according to fabius, who calls these divisions tribes also and, adding the four city tribes to them, says that there were thirty tribes in all under tullius. but according to vennonius he divided the country into thirty-one parts, so that with the four city tribes the number was rounded out to the thirty-five tribes that exist down to our day. however, cato, who is more worthy of credence than either of these authors, does not specify the number of the parts into which the country was divided. [2] after tullius, therefore, had divided the country into a certain number of parts, whatever that number was, he built places of refuge upon such lofty eminences as could afford ample security for the husbandmen, and called them by a greek name, pagi or \"hills.\" thither all the inhabitants fled from the fields whenever a raid was made by enemies, and generally passed the night there. [3] these places also had their governors, whose duty it was to know not only the names of all the husbandmen who belonged to the same district but also the lands which afforded them their livelihood. and whenever there was occasion to summon the countrymen to take arms or to collect the taxes that were assessed against each of them, these governors assembled the men together and collected the money. and in order that the number of these husbandmen might not be hard to ascertain, but might be easy to compute and be known at once, he ordered them to erect altars to the gods who presided over and were guardians of the district, and directed them to assemble every year and honour these gods with public sacrifices. this occasion also he made one of the most solemn festivals, calling it the paganalia; and he drew up laws concerning these sacrifices, which the romans still observe. [4] towards the expense of this sacrifice and of this assemblage he ordered all those of the same district to contribute each of them a certain piece of money, the men paying one kind, the women another and the children a third kind. when these pieces of money were counted by those who presided over the sacrifices, the number of people, distinguished by their sex and age, became known. [5] and wishing also, as lucius piso writes in the first book of his annals, to know the number of the inhabitants of the city, and of all who were born and died and arrived at the age of manhood, he prescribed the piece of money which their relations were to pay for each — into the treasury of ilithiya (called by the romans juno lucina) for those who were born, into that of the venus of the grove (called by them libitina) for those who died, and into the treasury of juventas for those who were arriving at manhood. by means of these pieces of money he would know every year both the number of all the inhabitants and which of them were of military age. [6] after he had made these regulations, he ordered all the romans to register their names and give in a monetary valuation of their property, at the same time taking the oath required by law that they had given in a true valuation in good faith; they were also to set down the names of their fathers, with their own age and the names of their wives and children, and every man was to declare in what tribe of the city or in what district of the country he lived. if any failed to give in their valuation, the penalty he established was that their property should be forfeited and they themselves whipped and sold for slaves. this law continued in force among the romans for a long time.', '[16.1] after all had given in their valuations, tullius took the registers and the size of their estates, introduced the wisest of all measures, and one which has been the source of the greatest advantages to the romans, as the results have shown. [2] the measure was this: he selected from the whole number of the citizens one part, consisting of those whose property was rated the highest and amounted to no less than one hundred minae. of these he formed eighty centuries, whom he ordered to be armed with argolic bucklers, with spears, brazen helmets, corslets, greaves and swords. dividing these centuries into two groups, he made forty centuries of younger men, whom he appointed to take the field in time of war, and forty of older men, whose duty it was, when the youth went forth to war, to remain in the city and guard everything inside the walls. [3] this was the first class; in wars it occupied a position in the forefront of the whole army. next, from those who were left he took another part whose rating was under ten thousand drachmae but not less than seventy-five minae. of these he formed twenty centuries and ordered them to wear the same armour as those of the first class, except that he took from them the corslets, and instead of the bucklers gave them shields. here also he distinguished between those who were over forty-five years old and those who were of military age, constituting ten centuries of the younger men, whose duty it was to serve their country in the field, and ten of the older, to whom he committed the defence of the walls. this was the second class; in engagements they were drawn up behind those fighting in the front ranks. [4] the third class he constituted out of those who were left, taking such as had a rating of less than seven thousand five hundred drachmae but not less than fifty minae. the armour of these he diminished not only by taking away the corslets, as from the second class, but also the greaves. [5] he formed likewise twenty centuries of these, dividing them, like the former, according to their age and assigning ten centuries to the younger men and ten to the older. in battles the post and station of these centuries was in the third line from the front.', 'again taking from the remainder those whose property amounted to less than five thousand drachmae but was as much as twenty-five minae, he formed a fourth class. this he also divided into twenty centuries, ten of which he composed of such as were in the vigour of their age, and the other ten of those who were just past it, in the same manner as with the former classes. he ordered the arms of these to be shields, swords and spears, and their post in engagements to be in the last line. [2] the fifth class, consisting of those whose property was between twenty-five minae and twelve minae and a half, he divided into thirty centuries. these were also distinguished according to their age, fifteen of the centuries being composed of the older men and fifteen of the younger. these he armed with javelins and slings, and placed outside the line of battle. [3] he ordered four unarmed centuries to follow those that were armed, two of them consisting of armourers and carpenters and of those whose business it was to prepare everything that might be of use in time of war, and the other two of trumpeters and horn-blowers and such as sounded the various calls with any other instruments. the artisans were attached to the second class and divided according to their age, one of their centuries following the older centuries, and the other the younger centuries; [4] the trumpeters and horn-blowers were added to the fourth class, and one of their centuries also consisted of the older men and the other of the younger. out of all the centuries the bravest men were chosen as centurions, and each of these commanders took care that his century should yield a ready obedience to orders.']\n",

      "[\"dawn was breaking on sunday morning, the seventh day of the month, on the island of oahu. aside from its status as a tourist mecca, the island was home to several major american military facilities, including the huge naval base at pearl harbor and the army's hickam airfield. for the soldiers and sailors, the day began like any other sunday, with a skeleton crew on duty while many others slept off their saturday night's revelries.\", \"for over a week, unknown to the island's commanders, a large fleet had been steaming toward the hawaiian islands, operating under strict radio silence and without running lights to avoid detection. the fleet sailed to the north of the islands, far beyond the normal shipping lanes, to reduce the chances of being detected by u.s. naval patrols or commercial ships. this time of year found the northern pacific storm-tossed, and as the fleet pressed on toward its target, it adjusted its course to sail inside rain squalls.\", \"early that sunday, following a high-speed run, the fleet's aircraft carriers came within one hundred miles of pearl harbor, their principal target. an hour before daybreak pilots scrambled into their planes. shortly thereafter the carriers launched their strike aircraft, more than 150 in all, a mix of fighters, dive-bombers, and torpedo planes, which quickly moved into formation and headed through the night sky for oahu. their mission: execute raid plan no. 1. as the aircraft approached pearl harbor, the weather cleared, as if on cue. this enabled the strike formations to use the battery of searchlights at kahuku point as a navigation aid to guide them toward their targets.\", 'dawn was now breaking. as sunlight streamed over the horizon, the airborne strike force pressed home its attack over pearl harbor, achieving complete surprise. dive-bombers and torpedo planes went to work on the ships lying at anchor along battleship row, where the u.s. navy\\'s capital ships were berthed. fighter aircraft peeled off and strafed the airfield, hitting parked planes, fuel storage tanks, and hangars. army air corps pilots rushed to take off after the attacking force, but by the time they were aloft, the attackers had completed their strikes and vanished. failing to locate the attackers, the army aircraft returned to base, whereupon a second wave of carrier strike aircraft hit them. a _new york times_ reporter on the scene reported that the attacks were \"unopposed by the defense, which was caught virtually napping.\"1', 'surveying the results, the american defenders were filled with anger—and relief. the attack, executed on the morning of sunday, _february 7, 1932_ , occurred at the outset of a u.s. army-navy war game called grand joint exercise 4. rear admiral harry yarnell, commander of the newly commissioned american aircraft carriers _saratoga_ and _lexington_ , had launched the attacking planes. the \"bombs\" dropped were flour bags, which could be found splattered on the navy\\'s ships still sitting at anchor.', \"red-faced, the army air corps commanders sought to minimize the attack's results. they argued that the damage incurred to hickam field was minimal, and asserted that they had found and attacked yarnell's carriers. finally, they protested the attack on legal grounds—it was improper to begin a war on sunday!\", 'the war game\\'s umpires sided with the army. their report made no mention of yarnell\\'s attack but concluded that \"it is doubtful if air attacks can be launched against oahu in the face of strong defensive aviation without subjecting the attacking carriers to the danger of material damage and consequent great loss in the attacking] air force.\"2', 'nearly ten years later carriers of the imperial japanese navy, attacking pearl harbor on sunday, december 7, 1941, proved that admiral yarnell, not the umpires or the army, had gauged the future correctly. the admiral had been willing to confront uncomfortable possibilities, whereas others had not. although america was shocked by the japanese attack, many in the navy were not. as admiral chester w. nimitz, the architect of the navy\\'s victorious campaign against japan, ruefully admitted, \"nothing that happened in the pacific was strange or unexpected.\"3', 'nearly six years after admiral yarnell\\'s \"surprise attack\" on pearl harbor, in the fall of 1937 the world witnessed by far the largest field exercises held in germany since the great war that had led to its humiliation at versailles. these maneuvers were conducted on the north german plain. some eight infantry divisions took part. (the entire u.s. army today comprises only ten divisions.) but the size of the enterprise was not its only notable aspect: appearing for the first time in these exercises was the wehrmacht\\'s third panzer division and the first panzer division\\'s first panzer brigade. these formations had not existed during the great war. indeed, they had only just been formed. the two novel units were unusual in several respects. most conspicuous was their emphasis on mechanization. they boasted a massive number of tanks, some eight hundred in all. their appearance in the exercise produced a heightened sense of expectation, which extended all the way up the army\\'s chain of command to the german general staff. rather than the two-day length typical of most annual exercises, these maneuvers were to span a full week.4', \"the third panzer's attack plan involved using its infantry forces to engage enemy troops defending a bridgehead, while its armored forces attacked the defenders' left flank. the objective was for the panzers— the german word for armor, or tanks—to break through the enemy lines. the attack was everything the wehrmacht's most ardent panzer advocates could have hoped for. after a hundred-kilometer approach march, the division went into the attack, quickly forcing the enemy to commit its reserves. even these proved insufficient to arrest the panzers. the following day the third panzer not only broke through the enemy front but penetrated deep into its rear area. confronted with armored forces prowling behind its shattered lines, the enemy's position quickly unraveled. what had been planned as a week-long exercise was decided in only four days.\", 'the chief of the german general staff, general ludwig beck, on hand to observe the field maneuvers, was less than enthusiastic about the results. he believed that the umpires\\' rulings were too generous to the mechanized forces. the panzer division was ordered removed from further play. still, general beck admitted that the \"friendly\" force had \"solved the problem allotted to it, through a well-planned, swift, and energetic use of its means.\" general franz halder, who would succeed beck as chief of the general staff a year later, was stunned by the \"fluid mobility\" in the third panzer\\'s operations.5 indeed, the world had witnessed the first major demonstration of _blitzkrieg_ , or \"lightning war.\"']\n",

      "[\"pobably you've picked up this book because you or someone close to you has a problem with an addiction. perhaps you (or they) smoke, drink too much, eat too much, gamble or shop beyond your means, or maybe even take drugs. undoubtedly you've been told, as we all have, that this problem is a disease for which you must seek medical treatment or join a support group—something that perhaps you have resisted doing. you see and hear this message in so many places— in school, in the media, from government organizations, and from treatment providers—that you may not even ask yourself whether it's accurate. but if you thought about it for a few minutes, you'd realize it just isn't so.\", 'people quit addictions on their own all the time. we all know this is the case. how many people do you know who quit cigarettes, the most common and the most powerful of drug addictions? did you do so? in the united states, tens of millions of people have quit smoking without treatment, about half of those who have ever smoked.1', 'surprisingly, the percentage of former heroin, cocaine, and alcohol addicts who have quit on their own is even higher. yet an enormous treatment/recovery industry, backed by a large government bureaucracy, tells us that it is virtually impossible to quit an addiction—and completely impossible to do so without the use of all their services.', \"of course, private treatment centers have a vested interest in this debate. these are the ones that treat robert downey jr., charlie sheen, ben affleck, and their ilk, often repeatedly. it's obvious why they insist that quitting addictions takes repeated, expensive stays at their facilities. even the services of alcoholics anonymous (aa) can come with a price: many claim that no one can succeed in overcoming alcoholism unless they remain in aa or another twelve-step group.\", 'less well known is that the government has invested millions to get an \"addictive disease\" message across. the national institute on drug abuse (nida) is the government agency responsible for getting to the root of drug abuse. the nida was headed by alan leshner from 1994 through 2001—a period during which its annual budget doubled to $781 million.', 'leshner is best known for his color slide show presentation, which \"proved\" how addiction to certain drugs, such as cocaine, occurs because these drugs stimulate certain parts of the brain. his powerpoint presentation featured brain scans and diagrams.2 leshner was replaced as head of the nida in 2003 by brain researcher nora d. volkow, m.d., who has indicated that she will extend this vision of addiction.3', 'according to leshner, stimulation of certain parts of the brain causes it to adjust so as to become hooked on the drug that stimulates it. after a certain point, addiction becomes inevitable. in making this case, leshner insists that addiction is a medical illness that mandates treatment. according to leshner, \"it\\'s a myth that millions of people get better by themselves.\"4', 'but this former nida chief is misinformed. research, including studies funded by the united states government, shows that it is untrue. numerous cases we all know about, and in our own lives, show that it is not true.', 'that industry, government, and faith-based organizations unite on the point that people cannot quit addictions independently makes this one of the few areas of unanimity among them. it seems ironic that all sectors of american society should be so concerned to drive home the same erroneous point.', \"some other countries take a very different stance on addiction. for example, the swiss government conducted a public information campaign to inform smokers and heroin addicts that the idea of addiction as inevitably a lifetime burden is a myth. posters were displayed around the country with the message that most drug users succeed in quitting their habit. swiss public health officials recognize that most addicts don't seek treatment, and many nonetheless overcome their habit. yet they want to encourage even greater numbers of addicts to overcome addiction—and they want them to do it sooner rather than later.5\", 'it is important for you to know that an independent, self-motivated cure for addiction, called natural remission, is possible. you can fight your own addictions, whether to drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, shopping, gambling—you name it. following are major examples of this phenomenon that you can keep in mind when confronting your destructive habits.']\n",

i dived into research. i went to my favorite medical library at the university of california at los angeles (ucla), scoured the internet, and read everything i could find on these chemicals. before long, i found out that nickel is a known common cause of skin rashes and allergic reactions. a first clue! i remembered experiencing something similar when i was a teenager. every time i wore costume jewelry—jewelry not made of real gold—i would develop a rash on my earlobes until i stopped wearing it. \"nickel allergy—like mother, like son!\" i thought.', \"my mind was racing. where was cody being exposed to nickel? all his meals were made of organic pureed food. but then it hit me: every time we fed him we were using _stainless-steel_ spoons. not only that but all our pots and pans were made of stainless steel or aluminum. i quickly replaced all our cookware with iron, glass, and enamel, which tend to be nonallergenic. i started using wooden and porcelain spoons for cody's meals, and—surprise, surprise!—within a week, the rash under his chin went away.\", \"i was elated. i thought that with a little scientific knowledge, detective work, and homegrown experimentation, i had cured his allergies. wishful thinking! although the rash under the chin did subside, we had only begun what was to become a three-year battle with allergy symptoms. from this time until his first birthday, cody started to experience other allergies: constant nasal congestion and runny nose, frequent colds, hives, and rashes on the face and body. he had several respiratory distress illnesses that the doctors finally diagnosed as asthma, which, as you may know, is a breathing condition in which the respiratory airways constrict, making breathing difficult. eczema and rhinitis (inflammation of the mucous membranes in the nasal passages) were a daily thing, but this time around, the doctors couldn't really help. the drugs they prescribed for rhinitis made his heart race and made him anxious and nervous. the cortisone creams worked only half the time. that left the other half. and when his entire body was red and inflamed, it was impossible to cover it all with the cream. i knew that too much cortisone could be harmful for a child's delicate skin and body. i grew despondent, troubled. i turned to george, my family, and friends for support, but it seemed as if things would never improve.\"]\n",

      "[\"the sensuous scarlet glow from the floor lamp in the cheaply furnished room seeped under the partially closed lids of baron's eyes, and he lay rigidly on the bed, thinking it all through one more time with a kind of fevered relentlessness. he tried to shut his mind against the harsh sounds of elene's quick movements as she crossed and recrossed the room. he heard her hesitate before the dresser and her skirt lifted, a garter snapped against flesh, the skirt was lowered, smoothed. she cleared her throat, recommenced the nervous stalking from the wall to the scantily curtained windows overlooking the rue paradis and that strange, hour-lingering yellow twilight of late afternoon in marseilles. back and forth she stalked, to and fro, and baron actually held his breath as he drove deep again into tight remembering. he recalled the chronologically ordered moments of the past two and a half years, perspiring and slowly thinking his way straight to this empty-handed present — to this cheap room with this cheap cocotte who somehow still possessed her soul. and to what was left of himself, frank baron. even seeing it clearly, he would never admit defeat. there was too much hate for that — too much of everything.\", \"you don't trace and seek a man for endless months, across continents, through endless cities, beyond mountains and plains, and then suddenly drop it. the insane part of it was that he really searched for a man's existence. because he had never seen the man. a human being that existed. somewhere....\", \"yes, he thought. he destroyed me. he destroyed my life. somewhere i'll find him — someday.\", 'like bright black moments on a stark white screen, the tragic elements of the remembering sprang tauntingly awake, and he experienced the usual torture. those frenzied weeks before the trials. the waiting and the cruelly patient days during which he lost his wife and his daughter, bette. losing patricia, knowing she had left him, he could stand that — but bette was something else again. the headlines, screaming, \"traitor!\" the closed factories he had once been so proud of, and the closed bank accounts, too. all gone. finished, like so much sand washed along a smooth curb into the sewer. because all the time there had been inside him this howling cry, yelling at them that they were wrong. none heard. not even that day on the witness stand, when the cry burst past his lips.', \"it had taken more than one hand to accomplish everything, he knew. but he also knew that a single mind had conceived the major plan. with meagerly rationed money from a single secret bank account that his understanding lawyer had arranged for him, he began the search without a clue. he had only his oath, sworn passionately to himself, of vengeance. he did not like the word itself, because it somehow cheapened the quest. but cheap or not, that's what it was. so from the environs of the closed airplane factories, from the midwest cities, he pursued a nebulous trail of talk. and very gradually he discovered the faint, elusive, but telltale aura of a _modus operandi_. a careful rationalization of this alone led him from new york to chicago to san francisco, then to mexico city and panama and tokyo and down through brazil and back to new orleans and kansas city, tracing the dim trail of that mind's existence. questioning everywhere. to capetown, to italy, then back home. to rome and paris and home again, with the money dwindling fast now. but with the trail sometimes brightening, almost as if that mind paused to laugh, just around the corner, allowing baron to hear the laughter. but faintly. then, suddenly bright, it had led him to paris — and now marseilles. the money was all gone now, everything he owned pawned or sold, and the trail was absolutely ended.\", 'there was nothing left to go on. it was like carrying a pail brimming with precious water for miles, only to discover suddenly that the pail had no bottom. that there had never been any water.', 'baron twisted on the bed, keeping his eyes closed and fiercely closing his mind to remembering. he did not want to remember now, only to rush skimming along the surface of things. to remember the details of each interim clearly was to go on through torture that would leave him spent, exhausted.', \"elene. he had forgotten her. she meant a great deal to him and he wondered momentarily what would eventually happen to them. and as he wondered, the memories slipped away, and he began to be himself again, slowly. he relaxed, with only the ghosts haunting him. the newspapers had followed his journey quite well, but they termed it debauch. frank baron's death fling. well, let them think it. to hell with everything but _him_.\", '\"yes?\" he looked at her and she smiled at him with that quick motion of the head and shoulders that helped to reveal the self-conscious boldness he admired.', 'he said nothing, watching her. he knew she didn\\'t like being watched. it made her move her head and shoulders still more and he liked seeing this. scarlet touched her cheeks and her dark eyes sparkled and he wished they could go someplace far beyond far mountains. he knew he would never find a better companion, a more understanding lover. since they had met that night in the café, she refused to leave him. she liked his nose. _she_ refused to speak of any other reason for remaining with him. \"it is your nose,\" she told him. \"it is a great, defiant nose. a strong block of a nose. a nose with character. many persons have noses that are entertaining,\" she told him. \"but none is so interesting as your nose, _chéri_. let it go at that, then. i am in love with your nose.\"', \"for his own part, he had never imagined a prostitute could be anything like elene. he had heard the stories, but he had never met one. not like elene. for many days now he had refused to admit to himself that she had any calling other than their own life together. he couldn't understand why she stayed with him. he knew he was boresome. they had not eaten regularly. they were behind in their rent. looking at her now, he wished they could always be together. if peace might ever be found, then surely elene had helped to show him a way.\"]\n",

      "[\"the sunlight begins to glint through the tallest of the pines rimming a pristine new england lake, illuminating the thick layer of haze that's slowly releasing its grip on the water and providing glimpses through to the sapphire below. standing on the edge of a quiet dock, the moist wood slippery under bare feet, the solitary athlete absorbs a view that's all at once majestic and ephemeral as the day arrives. as you dip your toe, the summery warmth of the water dispels any allusion to fall as more colors continue to appear in the water; neon orange and lime green orbs now bob within feet of each other and within minutes the area directly in front of the dock has been transformed into a floating mardi gras parade awash with bright and garish colors.\", \"it's now your turn to take the plunge, adding the color of your swim cap to the dots floating just above the surface. you hit the water and feel the lake grip at your wetsuit, and the sparkling water washes over your face as you bob gently, buoyant from the neoprene and your legs treading water below you. all those thoughts of the race yet to unfold that ran through your head while standing on the dock fade from your mind as you focus on the task at hand. weeks of training and planning have prepared for this one moment. the millions of thoughts ranging from conditions to nutrition, gear to competition all dissipate like the haze over the water. you are confident in your preparation. you are confident in your ability and you are ready to race right here, right now. the only thought that sticks in your mind is to keep moving forward: in the water, on the bike and during the run.\", \"all at once the enormity of the day reveals itself in your mind: swimming side by side with hundreds of other athletes all vying for position, a washing machine of flailing arms and legs stretched out over a thousand meters in open water, before returning to shore and rapidly switching gears—literally—by shedding your swimming gear and transforming into a cyclist for the next stage of the day's competition. through the twists and turns, speedy downhills and grueling ascents, the steely determination to pass or be passed overtakes the next two hours of exhausting effort as you push your quads to their limit and keep turning the cranks with every ounce of energy you have left. returning to transition is a blur of rapid motion, a cacophony of sounds as the announcer whips the crowd into a frenzy; friends and family scream your name as you perform a coordinated dance of returning your bike back to its perch on the rack while ripping off your helmet and bike shoes and applying the required gear for the run. the final challenge between you and the finish line, the run is where mental and physical strength are paramount—pushing your body through barriers  of exhaustion toward the euphoric highs as you power around the course, one foot in front of the other, until...\", 'you finish the day as a newer version of yourself—you will have been transformed into a _triathlete_.', 'many people settle for things in life. they settle for a crappy job, marriage, friends, food, place to live and overall fitness and health. those who desire more, or those who want more out of life than a drive-thru window and boring sitcom, will choose triathlon or an activity that makes them happy–an activity that will change their life.', \"hi, i'm brett. running was never my thing. i wasn't fast and surely didn't have much in the way of endurance, but at least i was a lousy swimmer too. it's easy to see how i'd become a triathlete with a background like that, right? prior to my first triathlon, the last time i'd ridden a road bike was when i was 15 years old—nearly 20 years earlier.\", 'at the age of 34, most life-altering changes are spawned by one stark, defining moment. a guy might lose his job and decide to hike the appalachian trail. a woman may get divorced, devote herself to yoga and open her own studio. in my case, it was an anecdotal comment by my friend chris goggin, who told me how impressed he was that a mutual friend, matt perkins, had recently completed his first triathlon. i was immediately awestruck. prior to matt tackling that winding trails event, i knew exactly zero people who had ever competed in a triathlon. suddenly, a new door opened and completing a triathlon seemed _somewhat_ possible. i say \"somewhat\" because the longest i\\'d ever run was 2 miles, with the aforementioned chris goggin, in my first race ever—a little duathlon on the connecticut shoreline in 2004.', 'after running close to a half mile and walking the rest, the bike portion of that first race was spent chasing after a dropped water bottle, fixing my chain that was continually falling off and pushing my sad excuse for a mountain bike up anything that resembled a hill. the final insult was another run of 2 miles once i\\'d parked the bike, and i was dreading every step until something strange happened: i heard the crowd, saw my family and observed the other competitors doing something nearly unbelievable to my fatigued mind—they were enjoying themselves! i let the energy and emotion wash over me for a moment, then figured, \"what the hell? i\\' m here, i\\'m already tired and sweaty—why not try to have some fun?\" and i did.', 'in my very first multisport event i learned the lessons of the highs and lows of endurance racing, and that knowledge has served me well for the better part of a  decade. the birth of my children and wedding day (the second one) aside, crossing that finish line was one of the best moments of my life. immediately afterward over coffee and a bagel, chris and i planned our next event—we were going to do a triathlon ourselves.', 'the story on pages 7 and 8 was based on the memory of my first triathlon in 2005, the timberman short course at lake winnipesaukee in new hampshire. the reason i introduced myself is to set my multisport expertise apart from that of my coauthor, lewis elliot, a professional triathlete. while i\\'m an experienced triathlete and extremely passionate about the sport, my forte is getting first-timers into it through education and training to promote comfort and confidence. as a trainer, coach and tri-race director, i\\'ve had the opportunity to introduce hundreds of \"newbies\" to the sport of triathlon and have been blessed to train clients for events ranging from finishing their first sprint tri all the way up to setting a new ultra-distance personal best.', 'when cofounding the espn triathlon team back in 2005 with michael deangelo and nicole greene, it was immediately apparent to us that so many athletes knew so little about the sport of triathlon, whether it be a lack of knowledge about equipment, training, race format or even signing up for their first race. triathlon is not a sport where you just show up and start racing—it all starts with learning the basics. this book is dedicated to educating new athletes getting into the sport (yeah, you\\'re called a \"newbie\"), and also to train experienced triathletes to get to the next level with pro tips plucked from lewis\\'s bag of tricks. so, whether you\\'re interested in \"tri-ing\" for yourself or are already hooked on multisport, this book has something for athletes of all levels.']\n",

      "[\"as a child i learnt about green house gases and their effects. i was taught about them in an impassive way – they were just facts, that was what was going to happen, there was no choice in the matter. i remember this niggling doubt, not only about the ozone layer, but about all sorts of things that were happening in the world that seemed to be blatantly bad things – shouldn't people be paying a bit more attention? shouldn't we be responding more to these problems and trying to change things? there was a question lurking in the background of my mind – what could i do to make a difference?\", \"fast forward to the 1990s and i was at university. the millennium, which had seemed as far away as the predicted crisis for the ozone layer, was now on the horizon. the above questions were still very present for me but i was no nearer to finding answers. then permaculture slowly crept into my life. permaculture is a method of using nature as a guide to design for sustainability. it is a way of thinking that promotes resourcefulness, resilience and creativity. (see page 16 for a fuller explanation.) at first my head didn't really understand the concept, but my senses responded to eating flowers in salads and seeing frogs in simple ponds made from washing up bowls. friends came back from courses and i sensed a difference in them. they were full of vitality and ideas and were strongly grounded. they were living in an abundant flow of ideas, vegetables, connections, generosity, passion and purpose.\", 'participating in a permaculture course myself, the ideas took root in my head, heart and hands. i was amongst others who saw problems and were asking themselves what am i going to do? what are we going to do? where are the solutions? can we create solutions? and together we were living a strong belief that, _yes_ we _can_ create solutions. a creative life force was awakened within me. the question – _what can i do to make a difference?_ – shifted from the background of my mind to the foreground.', \"as i connected with other people on similar journeys, i became more aware of the strength of working co-operatively. i felt empowered because it wasn't all just talk, it moved into action; we went from thinking to doing. i found perma culture to be full of inspiration, magic and common sense.\", \"permaculture grew in my life, and as i learnt to think like nature i became more sensitive of my own nature, and of myself as a natural system. i also became conscious of the limits for the growth of permaculture. i couldn't understand why earthcare wasn't happening more quickly, if there were so many solutions available to us. i realised that limits are often within us as people, whether it is on an individual level, how we relate to our family, patterns of community living, governmental structures, or international politics. at all levels our dynamics as people can interfere with us looking after each other and the earth.\", \"i also perceived how much more potential perma culture has for reaching out to people and helping them to live productive, abundant lives. my vision and purpose became about finding ways to make permaculture more accessible and relevant. i wrote _people & permaculture_ to widen the definition of permaculture beyond gardens and farming and translate it for use for anyone and everyone. since its publication thousands of people globally have benefited from it's processes and structure and have engaged in personal and social designs.\", 'meanwhile the work that reconnects has become a more prominent part of my journey. the work that reconnects is set of workshop methods designed to engage us more fully with the world around us, and the consequences of the actions of humanity. (see page 19 for more details on this subject.) it has allowed me to fully embrace my appreciation of the world and myself. i have been invited to lower my numbness bar and open my heart to feel pain for the suffering and destruction i witness in the world. i have felt the continuity of life and expanded into larger timeframes, i have shifted to thinking for the future. i have connected with a deeper source of courage and willingness to speak for a better world and to act on behalf of future generations. experiential activities have given me ways in which to embody our interconnectedness with all beings, and backed this up with systems theory.', \"i began this book as a way of answering the question i am most often asked – what is permaculture? there is so much need in the world for inspiration and tools for positive change, and i wanted to find an elegant way to convey the magic, hope and possibilities that permaculture contains. as i reflected upon my journey, i realised it was ways of thinking that had changed and made key differences; they opened up fresh horizons and instigated new behaviours, which have led to exciting outcomes. changing attitudes of heart and mind have enabled me to feel more secure, positive and proactive. i know there are many people on comparable paths searching for more meaning and purpose. i began to characterise these ways of thinking so that they can open similar doors for others and make real and immediate differences in people's lives.\", 'while permaculture and the work that reconnects are different in their methods, i discovered that there are shifts in thinking that are common to both. and indeed there are many other techniques for positive change that fit within these ways. the two approaches have grown together very organically to compose these seven ways to think differently.', 'the seven ways are; **abundance thinking** – living in gratitude and balance; **solutions thinking** – believing there are solutions to any problem; **systems thinking** – sensing the interconnectedness of all life; **thinking like nature** – discovering nature around us reflected within us; **thinking for the future** – considering larger timeframes; **co-operative thinking** – learning to collaborate with each other; and **from thinking to doing** – moving into action and turning our dreams into reality.', 'the synergy of permaculture and the work that reconnects is potent medicine for a world full of challenges and opportunities. both offer ways of dramatically shifting the direction humanity is currently taking. the seven ways are all easy to grasp and can bring about significant benefits. they work on many levels from personal to social to ecological to global. here is my offering to you, a way of simplifying and deepening the profound messages that permaculture and the work that reconnects have to offer. these ways to think differently can shift us to a better present as well as a better future.']\n",
