      "line is: **O** n a Sunday morning in December 1965, three-year-old Sarah Morrisett awoke to streams of soft light on her pillow. She pulled herself upright on the bed and blinked. Zipped into pink footie pajamas, Sarah hopped down to the edge of the mattress and stretched across the bedspread to grab her \"nockey,\" a faded, frayed security blanket she had been dragging around since taking her earliest steps.\n",
      "line is: Her parents, Lloyd and Mary, slept soundly, only steps away in the master bedroom of the family's ranch-style home in Irvington, New York. Built along the Hudson, Irvington was a quiet refuge of workaday villagers, shopkeepers, and a smattering of commuters who worked downriver in Manhattan. The Morrisetts had hoped to sleep in that morning, or, with the Almighty's good graces, stay under the covers until at least 8:00 a.m. An early walker and a chatterbox, Sarah had light brown, slightly wavy hair and a propensity for whirling about in a tutu, repeating jingles she had memorized from television. Like Sarah, it was, her parents thought, adorable.\n",
      "line is: To be three is to be absorbent, kinetic, inquisitive, exuberant, determined, malleable, and uninhibited. Sarah was a boundlessly energetic entertainer and, at bedtime, an attentive listener who enjoyed storybooks, her blanket close at hand. Because her parents believed in the social benefits of nursery school, Sara attended a private nondenominational one situated in a church hall. Though Sarah was smaller than most of the other children, she thrived in the play-school atmosphere.\n",
      "line is: Her nimble little hands had no problem popping open the doors to the cabinet-style TV set in the living room, transforming an idle and inert piece of furniture into an electronic theater that came to life at her command.\n",
      "line is: As she sat cross-legged on the floor there was nothing much to watch on local TV so early on a Sunday, beyond a test pattern. Sarah cupped her hands over her ears to block out the test's constant shrill tone, transfixed by a picture of an ascetic Indian chief in full headdress on a field of geometric shapes.\n",
      "line is: Sarah understood that if she waited patiently, the Indian would soon vanish. An unseen announcer would then begin the broadcast day with a recitation of FCC-mandated station-identification drone, followed by the National Anthem, played over a film that panned Mount Rushmore, the Statue of Liberty, and, depending on whether you owned a color or a black-and-white set, either amber waves of grain or amorphous waves of gray.\n",
      "line is: Rousted from a sound sleep that December morning, Lloyd Morrisett followed the trail of TV noise to find Sarah spellbound in front of the Indian. The clock had not struck seven.\n",
      "line is: For a moment, Morrisett stood in wonder as Sarah stared blankly at the TV. \"It struck me there was something fascinating to Sarah about television,\" said her father, an experimental psychologist with a PhD from Yale, much later. \"What is a child doing watching the station identification signal? What does this mean?\"\n",
      "line is: Morrisett's search for meaning in a preschool child's enthrallment with television would have far-reaching implications for preschool children in America and beyond. In a real sense, one could say there may not have been a _Sesame Street_ had Morrisett not been intrigued that morning, watching his preschooler watch television.\n",
      "line is: A few months later, Morrisett offered the test-pattern story as a conversational gambit during a dinner party held at the Manhattan apartment of Tim and Joan Cooney. The Morrisetts and the Cooneys had been indirectly introduced by Joan's cousin and Morrisett's boyhood friend, Julian Ganz, who operated successful furniture stores in Southern California. When the Morrisetts moved East from Berkeley in 1958, Julian had suggested to Morrisett that he look up Joan, but it took him until 1961 to do so. Lloyd and Joan shared the occasional lunch thereafter, and the couples met socially from time to time.\n",
      "line is: Though the Cooneys were childless urban professionals and the Morrisetts were mortgage-holding suburban parents, the couples had been swept up in the tide of the times and shared the core beliefs of left-leaning Democrats. Disciples of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, they were ardent supporters of the Great Society initiatives of his successor, Lyndon Baines Johnson. They saw the expansion of federally funded social programs as a remedy to the nation's ills, and they believed that a more racially tolerant and compassionate nation would unite to offer not a handout but a hand up to the dispossessed.\n",

      "line is: _Third base, defense: Fielding your position at third is tricky—that's why third base is called \"the hot corner.\" You have to be aware that anything can happen at any time. The hot corner is a world of deadly line drives and crazy \"bad hops,\" sacrifice bunts and long, difficult throws; it's a place where a lot of action happens that can make or break your team—and it's all just part of the game!_\n",
      "line is: I love baseball. I mean, I _really_ love baseball.\n",
      "line is: Sorry, let me be more clear: _Baseball_ is the most important thing in my life. I'm totally addicted; it's the one thing I've always been able to count on. Hey, I'm not exactly alone: If you Google the word \"baseball,\" you get 135,000,000 hits in .07 of a second—that's one hundred thirty-five _million_. Some people get strung out on meth or heroin, some on porno or Krispy Kremes, some on music, jogging, lifting weights, or on one of the \"lesser\" sports like hoops or football—but that ain't me. Nope, for me it's baseball above all, baseball or nothing. I'm Scott Latimer, eighteen years old, starting third baseman on Thompson High School's varsity baseball team.\n",
      "line is: So why is it that when things go wrong, in baseball _and_ in life, they sometimes go so hugely wrong? Why can't bad stuff come one thing at a time, so that you can handle that thing, get over it, and just get strong and ready to play a little ball? Why do bad things always seem to happen right when some good thing is out there ready for you to grab? Some great thing that you've worked for and dreamed about, right there, but when you reach for it, all your dreams just die.\n",
      "line is: It may not be fair to say, but it's my best friend Travis Adams's fault that right now I'm at the Spokane County Public Health building, sitting in an ugly orange vinyl chair. On a small white ticket in my hand is the number 23. What are the odds that when I pulled out a number from the stupid waiting-turn machine, I'd get my uniform number, 23, my \"lucky\" number? Maybe that's a good sign... but I doubt it.\n",
      "line is: The last number they called was 16, so it looks like I'm going to be here for a while. I've decided to get an AIDS test. I'm not gay; I'm not an IV drug user, either. I'm a third baseman. I shouldn't have to be worried about this stuff, and I know that it's borderline idiotic, or maybe over the borderline, that I'm even here. The chances that I have AIDS are probably low; but still, I need to find out.\n",
      "line is: This week, of all weeks, I should just be playing baseball. It's almost the end of my senior year—graduation is only a month away—and therefore it's also the end of my high school baseball career. The Spokane All-City High School Tournament starts later today. If we play well enough, and get a little lucky, we'll be in the championship game on Saturday. We've won a record-setting fourteen games in a row, unheard-of at the high school level—so really, this should be a great, amazing time. If I'm ever going to get noticed by a pro scout and get a chance to be drafted by a pro baseball team, it'll happen this week; I've gotta focus on baseball and nothing else—but instead I'm sitting in this uncomfortable chair, waiting to find out whether or not I'm a dead man.\n",
      "line is: I don't mean to sound melodramatic, but that _is_ the situation. I have to be sure that I don't have AIDS so that I can put it out of my mind and just concentrate on playing ball. I can't talk about this with my parents and I won't discuss it with Travis—who doesn't want to talk to me right now either. This is just something I have to do, and something I'd rather do by myself.\n",
      "line is: I walked in here half an hour ago. It's a stupid-looking building, a nasty brown brick place. When I first came in, I glanced around and found a directory of different programs on the wall. I saw listings for _Unwed Mothers, Aid to Dependent Children_ , _Substance Abuse_. Great list, huh? Obviously you come here only if you have problems—big ones! And then I spotted it: _HIV Testing—Room 105._\n",
      "line is: As I went in the direction of room 105, walking like a condemned man on his way to the electric chair, my mouth felt dry. I could feel my heart pounding inside of me. I hate needles, and all in all this is not a good place to be—I don't want people thinking I'm gay and who the hell wants to find out that you might be sick and never get to play baseball again? As I walked, I also started to feel dizzy. Finally I leaned against the wall for support. My stomach flip-flopped around, sweat broke out on my forehead, and I couldn't seem to catch my breath.\n",

      "line is: The hallway was deserted. Half-lit in gray shadow. I knew this place, didn't I?\n",
      "line is: The office doors that lined the marble hall were locked for the night, their opaque windows darkened. Waist-high ceramic pots cupping giant plastic rubber plants were situated between the doors to give the hall an illusion of warmth. I shivered as I watched her crouch behind one of the pots, hiding like a terrorized child. Her blond head shook while buried into her knees.\n",
      "line is: The door from the stairway access crashed open. A bulldog of a man lumbered in. The veins in the side of his neck accentuated the swastika tattoo half-visible, as if it crawled from under his collar. He gazed around, his little eyes alert for any movement.\n",
      "line is: Click. Clink. She dropped her activated cell phone into the pot. He didn't see that, but he heard the sound. He grinned, showing straight white capped teeth that contrasted with his swarthy cruel face.\n",
      "line is: \"Gotcha, bitch.\" His voice was softer than his face, girlish almost.\n",
      "line is: When she stood to face him, I marveled at her naïve bravery. Faster than his bound muscles should have allowed, he hoisted one of the huge pots and hurled it at her. Her hands covered her head against the impending lethal blow.\n",
      "line is: The vision evaporated. I was looking at her, Laura Bishop, but she was no longer in the hall or in mortal danger. Instead, she sat in front of me. One of my tarot clients, one of those who arrived dubious and would leave dubious and pissed off. I'd had enough doubters in my practice to recognize them and still not let them deter the process.\n",
      "line is: I looked at the tarot cards spread on the small table in the anonymous hotel room. I wasn't surprised to see the image glaring at me from one particular card. A body sprawled facedown, blood oozing from wounds caused by swords quilling the corpse's back. The Ten of Swords: betrayal.\n",
      "line is: \"Ms. Bishop, do you see that card there, in the future position?\" Disturbing images could be upsetting to clients, so I always addressed them immediately. Waiting only made clients focus on them to the point of missing anything else I had to say.\n",
      "line is: \"Uh, yeah, I do, Ms. Rosten. Do you psychic folks throw those things in there to scare your clients into coming back? Because, trust me, it won't work.\" One side of her jaw twitched as she tossed her accusation.\n",
      "line is: \"You may call me Devorah, or Dev, if you like. And, no, we don't create such cards to manipulate clients. In fact, that card makes rare appearances. So I suggest we discuss it for a moment before we move on.\"\n",

There was a bouquet of flowers on the passenger seat, his hands gripping the steering wheel were clammy, and with all his being he yearned for the healing, calming powers of alcohol. Tonight he must just please not make a total idiot of himself. Not in front of Alexa Barnard, not in front of all the stars of the music world, not after all the past week's planning and preparation.\n",
      "line is: He'd started on Monday, with a haircut. Tuesday, Mat Joubert's wife, Margaret, had been his style consultant at Romens in Tyger Valley. 'It's smart casual, Benny, just a pair of chinos and a smart shirt,' she had said patiently in her charming English accent.\n",
      "line is: 'No, I want a jacket too.' Griessel had dug in his heels, terrified of being caught between too 'casual' and not 'smart' enough. There would be some smart people there.\n",
      "line is: He had wanted a tie as well, but Margaret had put her foot down. 'Overdressed is worse than underdressed. No tie.' They had left with khaki chinos, a light blue cotton shirt, black belt, black shoes, a fashionable black jacket, and a credit card bill that made him shudder.\n",
      "line is: Since Wednesday he had been mentally preparing himself. He knew this thing, this event, had the potential to overwhelm him completely. His greatest fear was that he would swear, because that was what he always did when he got stressed. He would have to guard his tongue, all evening. No police-speak, no crude language, talk nice, stay calm. He had gone through it all in his imagination, visualised it, as Doc Barkhuizen, his sponsor at Alcoholics Anonymous, had prescribed.\n",
      "line is: To Anton L'Amour he would say: ' _Kouevuur_ is brilliant guitar.' That's all, no waxing lyrical and talking shit. To Theuns Jordaan: 'I like your work a lot.' That was a good thing to say, full of respect and appreciation, dignified. Lord, and if Schalk Joubert was there, he, Benny Griessel would take a deep breath, shake his hand and just say: 'Pleased to meet you, it's a great honour.' Then he had better walk away before the flood of words of hero worship, admiration of Joubert's mastery of bass guitar, spilled over all his careful defences.\n",
      "line is: If he could just have one drink before he met her. To keep his nerves from getting out of control. He would have to dry his hand on his new trousers first, he couldn't greet Lize Beekman with his palm all sweaty. 'Miss Beekman, it's an exceptional honour. Your music gives me great pleasure.' And she would say 'thank you', and he would leave it at that and go and find Alexa, because that was the only way he would keep from making a total idiot of himself.\n",

The windows in the middle and rear were blanked out with cheap white paint. The side panels differed slightly in colour from the rest of the vehicle.\n",

      "line is: Late Thursday afternoon, Teri Polgar went to the grocery store. Roaming the air-conditioned aisles, she decided to make her specialty—a macaroni-and-cheese casserole—for dinner that night. Some might consider it more of a winter meal, not really suitable for the middle of July, but Teri liked it any time of year. And Bobby—well, Bobby was hardly aware of what season it was, or for that matter, what time of day.\n",
      "line is: When she got home, she found her husband in front of a chessboard, deep in concentration. That in itself wasn't unusual. But the board was set up on the kitchen table and her younger brother was sitting across from him. Two out-of-the-ordinary occurrences.\n",
      "line is: Johnny grinned sheepishly when she walked in with her bag of groceries. \"I came by for a quick visit and Bobby insisted on teaching me,\" he explained.\n",
      "line is: Bobby mumbled something, probably an acknowledgment of her presence. He often muttered to himself, lost in his own world of chess moves and strategies. To say her husband was a bit unconventional would be an understatement. Bobby Polgar was an international chess sensation, one of the top-ranked players in the world.\n",
      "line is: \"How's it going?\" Teri asked as she set the groceries on the counter.\n",
      "line is: Johnny answered with a good-natured shrug. \"Haven't got a clue. Ask Bobby.\"\n",

      "line is: Bobby's hand squeezed hers and he looked across at Johnny. \"Always protect your queen,\" he advised her brother, who nodded patiently.\n",
      "line is: \"Can you stay for dinner?\" she asked Johnny. A visit from him, especially on a weekday, was a pleasant surprise. Teri was proud of Johnny, but she also felt protective of him. That was only natural, she supposed, because she'd practically raised him herself. Her family—like Bobby—was unconventional, but in a completely different way. At last count, her mother had been married six times. Or was it seven? Teri had lost count.\n",
      "line is: Her sister was more like her mother than Teri had ever been, but at least Christie was smart enough not to marry the losers who walked in and out of her life. Not that Teri was exempt from some of life's painful lessons herself. Particularly those that fell into the category of men-who-use-and-abuse.\n",
      "line is: Teri still had a hard time believing Bobby Polgar could love her. She worked in a hair and nail salon and considered herself the farthest thing from an intellectual. Bobby always said she had a real-world intelligence, practical and intuitive rather than cerebral, like his. She loved him for saying that and was even starting to believe it. In fact, she loved everything about him. The happiness she felt was still new to her and it actually frightened her a little.\n",

      "line is: The way I tell this story may be terrifying, Professor Gómez begins. And he adds: How can you narrate terror. So I won't back down, he says. Even if people criticize my story and the thoughts it provokes, I won't back down. As Martín Fierro says, \"I sing what I think, which is my way of singing.\" I know my story makes me sound like a gaucho minstrel on the run. Because anyone who tells it straight will always be a gaucho minstrel on the run.\n",
      "line is: Attention, demands the professor. When a song is popular with the powerful, it can't be trusted. People sing it for convenience's sake. They say fear's no fool. And what about terror. Terror makes a person more cunning. Not more intelligent, more cunning. Like a fox that eludes the hunting party. But that survival skill, when it's honed, becomes madness. Terror, that's what I'm going to talk about. I'll say it again: My story's not likely to amuse, because for me there's no joy in telling it.\n",
      "line is: In more than one way, this could be the story of an act of submission. Some might say it's brave to confess to an act of submission, but it's better not to commit it in the first place. And yet, if my story strikes anyone as funny, the humor probably has its merit: terror and laughter are incestuous siblings. The fact that now, perhaps more like a confession than a tale to be told, it seems to take on a bolder tone, doesn't redeem me. I'm an old man who repeats himself. I'm over eighty. And I have nothing to lose anymore except my papers. But papers, like words, blow away in the wind.\n",
      "line is: The professor adjusts his glasses and observes the overloaded, sagging shelves of his library, the double row of books, the piles of magazines and journals stashed against the walls, the tables, the chairs. He's surrounded by folders. There's a file cabinet on the table where he sets down his pitcher of iced tea. My mouth gets dry, he says. Then he asks about words. What are they good for. To name the unnamable, he reflects. We struggle to find the exact words to explain what hurts us most, as if by naming them our suffering might diminish. In our urgency to name it, we're distracted from pain.\n",
      "line is: Because in those days terror and poverty were all around us, the professor goes on. It was impossible not to see it, not to feel it. Then there was the cold snap of '77. For anyone who doesn't know what that fatal combination, terror and poverty, consists of, I'll explain it with a smell: the smell of jails and hospitals. There's a certain smell in jails, the same one you'll find in hospitals. Ammonia and piss, blending together in a kind of sweet stench. You can smell the shakes. It's a nausea that comes from filthy bodies and sticks to your clothes. Those out-of-date clothes that you rescue from the closet at the first frost. A jacket, a coat. Camphor and cheap cologne, the smell of poverty, the smell of cold shoes, which, logically, is also the smell of fear, of followed footsteps. Because fear and hunger go hand in hand, inseparable: a poor man always walks around frightened. He'll always get the blame for some debt, some failing.\n",
      "line is: I was around fifty-six at the time. But I was afraid I'd be blown up along with the kids, the suspected young militants. Gray hair didn't guarantee your safety. My state, like everyone else's, was one of terror. The only thing available, at least for believers, was the consolation of prayer. But who was there to pray to when God gives His blessing to the rich. There were a few parish saints left. The priests who accompanied the poor in their grief, whether because of their abject poverty or a disappearance, were fired by their church superiors, that is, when they weren't shot outright. God, if He had ever existed, was dead. It was more useful to seek help from the charlatans who pretended to be miracle workers. La Difunta Correa or Pancho Sierra offered more hope. Everyone latched onto what they could just to keep going. At that time, I fell ill with fear, but in addition to my medical license, I could also fall back on some unexpected money, my mother's inheritance. Neither her house nor her store on the coast, in a province that was the start of Patagonia, was worth very much. But that money gave me some breathing room. I could hold on for a long time with no other concerns but literary ones, even if they weren't so literary. In other words, I was in a privileged situation: like a tourist in a concentration camp. It drizzled all the time. You might ask, if I was aware of everything going on around me, why I didn't get the hell out of there. One explanation might be that I was paralyzed by terror. But it seems more reasonable to say that I was surviving by guiltily waiting for punishment. I still think so today. The drizzle continues.\n",
      "line is: The professor grows silent. His mouth is dry; he needs more tea. He stands, walks to the kitchen and after a while returns with a fresh pitcher. He sits, adds a half-teaspoon of sugar to his glass, a heavy glass, stirs, drinks, and after pushing the glass to one side, rummages in the file cards, removes one, looks at it, and puts it back again.\n",
      "line is: And I still don't know the answer, he reflects. Why I didn't get out. Instead of answers, more questions.\n",

      "line is: Another thought flashed through my mind. I don't have any children. Sheri and I had discussed children, but never seriously. I was ambivalent to the idea—until that moment. I now wanted a child.\n",
      "line is: Something else came to mind and frankly, it surprised me a little. I thought of my father. My father was a high school teacher. He was very influential in the community and coached three sports. With that schedule, he was busy. When we talked, it was mostly about sports. . . until he got cancer. During a poignant moment just before his death, he shared with me his only regret; he had not written his memoirs. Thinking about him and his words that day made me realize I had knowledge, a system, and a belief that needed to be shared. This book, the one you have in your hands or on your screen at this moment, is the accumulation of my learning, implementing, failing, and evaluating the strategies necessary to build a business based on others recommending me and my services. In your hands, you hold the strategies, techniques, and systems I used—and continue to use daily—to become known as _\"America's Most Referred Real Estate Professional.\"_\n",
      "line is: As I have been blessed with greater success, I have had the privilege of teaching and coaching others to do the same. This book tells the story of many of my coaching clients and members of my team; men and women who are ready to evolve from the Ego Era to the Generosity Generation. They are ready to stop wasting money on costly personal promotion and invest in relationships. They want to build more than a business; they want to leave a legacy.\n",
      "line is: If you want a business that will outlive you, this book will show you how to build it. If you are ready to build a large, highly profitable business using nothing but word of mouth, this book will provide you with the strategies, techniques, and resources you need. It is my hope that it will lead you not only to greater financial freedom, but also to a more fulfilling existence.\n",
      "line is: I wish my dad had put together his memoirs. It would be such a great read. I am now the father of a precious little boy. I imagine sitting on the floor during reading time with Max and reading my dad's stories, advice, and wisdom. After reading this book again, I realize that my dad and I wrote this together. I am honoring his legacy by passing on this knowledge. I survived that fateful day to help, teach, and coach others.\n",

      "line is: SOMETHING DRAWS THE EYE TO THE COUPLE WALKING INTO AN ITALIAN restaurant on the fringe of Manhattan's Gold Coast—the Upper East Side rectangle formed by Fifth and Park avenues between Fifty-ninth and Ninety-sixth streets—the man is hunched, halting, and stout, and the woman, stately and sylphic-thin. \"Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall,\" says the Book of Proverbs. The former plutocrat Saul Philip Steinberg and his third wife, Gayfryd, seem to embody that adage.\n",
      "line is: It is clear as they maneuver their way to their table at Sette Mezzo that Saul Steinberg still suffers from the effects of a devastating stroke he had a decade earlier. So Gayfryd gently guides him, holding one of his arms, the left one, the one that seems partly paralyzed. And as they pass their fellow diners, many of them members of the same super-wealthy clique the Steinbergs once led, friendly greetings are murmured aloud, while silently prayers are said—and not necessarily for Steinberg's health. Rather, they tend toward sentiments like, \"There but for the grace of God go I.\"\n",
      "line is: Saul Steinberg's stroke was followed by catastrophic financial reverses that upended his life at the turn of the millennium. Steinberg hit bottom on May 11, 2000, when his troubles drove him from his home of twenty-eight years, a sumptuous duplex apartment, previously owned by John D. Rockefeller Jr., atop 740 Park Avenue. Steinberg bought the place for $225,000 after Rockefeller's widow died in 1971, and sold it twenty-nine years later for approximately $30 million. It may have been the best investment in a life full of them. Yet it was not cause for celebration. Rather, it was a harrowing admission of defeat. Saul, friends say, is getting over the bouts of spontaneous sobbing he suffered after the stroke. But Gayfryd still cries over the hand fate has dealt them.\n",
      "line is: Once, Steinberg was the boy wonder of Wall Street. In 1961, fresh out of Wharton, the baby-faced business phenomenon opened a computer-leasing company that became one of the highest fliers in that decade's go-go market. Trading on the inflated value of his flash-in-the-pan technology stock, Steinberg swooped in on unsuspecting companies and bought large positions in their stocks. The first time he did it, in 1968, he conquered Reliance, a 151-year-old Philadelphia insurance company. Not yet thirty, he used its millions in cash reserves to reinvent himself as a swashbuckling corporate pirate who would soon attempt more takeovers of such iconic American companies as Chemical Bank, Walt Disney, and the New York Times.\n",
      "line is: After Reliance, Steinberg rarely succeeded, but that may have been beside the point. He usually raked in a fortune, either by selling when his moves goosed stock prices or by getting paid what became known, post-Saul, as greenmail.1 Corporations paid greenmail to foil takeovers—buying back their shares at a substantial premium over market value to make the likes of Steinberg go away. Quaker State paid him $10 million, Penn Central, $8 million. Then he turned on Disney. The house that Walt built paid him $60 million to go away, but in the process they also replaced their chief executive with a new one, Michael Eisner, who turned the vulnerable studio into a media colossus. No one thanked Saul Steinberg.\n",
      "line is: In 1981, forty-two-year-old Steinberg and his family controlled a $100 million fortune, according to the Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. By 1983, that stake had doubled. And in 1984, the magazine doubled its estimate again, to $400 million. His holding company, Reliance Group, was worth $3.7 billion. Steinberg's personal net worth peaked in September 1987 at about $660 million, then dropped by a third in a stock market crash. In the early 1990s, Reliance stock was still sinking and it owed $650 million in junk-bond debt, but _Forbes_ pegged Saul's personal fortune at $330 million, plumped up by the sale of Reliance's stakes in United Air Lines (for $100 million) and Days Inn ($765 million).\n",
      "line is: Steinberg always used his money as if trying to live up to a boast he'd made after raiding Reliance. \"Like the Rockefellers, I'll own the world,\" he'd said. Entertaining in imperial style, cultivating a fearsome public reputation, and a private one that blended charm with intelligence, while giving millions—both his own and Reliance's—to museums, libraries, and universities, he was deemed lordly. But that wasn't enough for him. A sign in his office read, in both English and Hebrew, \"On the eighth day, Saul rested.\"\n",
      "line is: Perhaps the hubris finally did him in. After his 1995 stroke, Steinberg fell off the Forbes 400 list of America's richest—and his life fell apart. He was even sued by his own mother. But the worst part was losing his home at 740 Park Avenue, for it was the apartment of his dreams. He'd bought it from the richest man in the world, the son of the greatest capitalist of the industrial age, the same son who'd overcome the family's rotten, bloody, grasping reputation to become the reigning paragon of American wealth. Saul had planned to repeat the accomplishments of Rockefeller father and son in a single lifetime.\n",
      "line is: Instead, he was forced to abdicate their throne as well as their apartment.\n",
      "line is: THE HOME THAT LINKED STEINBERG TO THE ROCKEFELLERS, APARTMENT 15/16B at 740 Park, was the most extraordinary apartment in New York City. Its magnificence is hard to overstate. Writing about 740 in _Town &_ _Country_ , Steven M. L. Aronson waxed lyrical over its \"imperially vast, insolently self-contained apartments [that] embody what V. S. Pritchett called 'the glamour of wealth and respectable certainty.' Unbudgingly supreme, they are not only New York's but the world's best addresses.\" Steinberg's was the best of them all.\n",
      "line is: It was \"a Manhattan residence of unsurpassed elegance, tradition, location, and proportions,\" a real estate agent would later say. Boasting more than twenty thousand square feet in a city where seven-hundred-square-foot studio apartments were the norm for thirty-two-year-olds, it had, depending on who was counting, anywhere from twenty-three to thirty-seven rooms, the discrepancy caused by such questions as whether one included hallways and foyers the size of ballrooms, servants' quarters, and the fourteen bathrooms.\n",

At least that's what President Hank \"Gator\" Griffin said on this crisp October morning at Bowling Green College.\n",

The child's face spattered in red mist, the president's mouth forming a question, the boy's tiny teeth glittering white in the camera flashbulbs, a cry from a Secret Service agent.\n",

There were many screams, many arms around him. A Secret Service agent grabbed the murderous boy as he dashed between a photographer's legs. The agent lifted Jesse Fowler high, by the ankle. The boy was furious, screaming obscenities no four-year-old should know. He swung his switchblade at the agent, knocking off the man's sunglasses. He swung again. And again.\n",
      "line is: More hands around the president. More screams from the crowd. Fowler's parents rushing the agent in shock, trying to protect their son. Secret Service agents covering Griffin's body with their own, his blood seeping into their suits. A scream rising from the child as he swung upside down by his ankle.\n",
      "line is: A chopper soon descended onto the campus's common field, its downdraft ripping the GRIFFIN/HALE signs from shocked spectators' hands. The president and an army of Secret Service and medical agents arrived at the Bowling Green hospital three minutes later. But Hank \"Gator\" Griffin was already dead by then.\n",

He gazed at a spattered GRIFFIN/HALE sign, which was reflected in the cruiser's window in one of those remarkable moments of photojournalism.\n",

      "line is: Bitter and drunk, Earl Blandon, a former United States senator, got home at 2:15 A.M. that Thursday with a new tattoo: a two-word obscenity in blue block letters between the knuckles of the middle finger of his right hand. Earlier in the night, at a cocktail lounge, he'd thrust that stiff digit at another customer who didn't speak English and who was visiting from some third-world backwater where the meaning of the offending gesture evidently wasn't known in spite of countless Hollywood films in which numerous cinema idols had flashed it. In fact, the ignorant foreigner seemed to mistake the raised finger for some kind of friendly hello and reacted by nodding repeatedly and smiling. Earl was frustrated directly out of the cocktail lounge and into a nearby tattoo parlor, where he resisted the advice of the needle artist and, at the age of fifty-eight, acquired his first body decoration.\n",
      "line is: When Earl strode through the front entrance of the exclusive Pendleton, into the lobby, the night concierge, Norman Fixxer, greeted him by name. Norman sat on a stool behind the reception counter to the left, a book open in front of him, looking like a ventriloquist's dummy: eyes wide and blue and glassy, pronounced marionette lines like scars in his face, head cocked at an odd angle. In a tailored black suit and a crisp white shirt and a black bow tie, with a fussily arranged white pocket handkerchief blossoming from the breast pocket of his coat, Norman was overdressed by the standards of the two other concierges who worked the earlier shifts.\n",
      "line is: Earl Blandon didn't like Norman. He didn't trust him. The concierge tried too hard. He was excessively polite. Earl didn't trust polite people who tried too hard. They always proved to be hiding something. Sometimes they hid the fact that they were FBI agents, pretending instead to be lobbyists with a suitcase full of cash and a deep respect for the power of a senator. Earl didn't suspect that Norman Fixxer was an FBI agent in disguise, but the concierge was for damn sure something more than what he pretended to be.\n",
      "line is: Earl acknowledged Norman's greeting with only a scowl. He wanted to raise his newly lettered middle finger, but he restrained himself. Offending a concierge was a bad idea. Your mail might go missing. The suit you expected back from the dry cleaner by Wednesday evening might be delivered to your apartment a week later. With food stains. Although flashing the finger at Norman would be satisfying, a full apology would require doubling the usual Christmas gratuity.\n",
      "line is: Consequently, Earl scowled across the marble-floored lobby, his embellished finger curled tightly into his fist. He went through the inner door that Norman buzzed open for him and into the communal hallway, where he turned left and, licking his lips at the prospect of a nightcap, proceeded to the north elevator.\n",
      "line is: His third-floor apartment was at the top of the building. He did not have a city view, only windows on the courtyard, and seven other apartments shared that level, but his unit was sufficiently well-positioned to justify calling it his penthouse, especially because it was in the prestigious Pendleton. Earl once owned a five-acre estate with a seventeen-room manor house. He liquidated it and other assets to pay the ruinous fees of the blood-sucking, snake-hearted, lying-bastard, may-they-all-rot-in-hell defense attorneys.\n",
      "line is: As the elevator doors slid shut and as the car began to rise, Earl surveyed the hand-painted mural that covered the walls above the white wainscoting and extended across the ceiling: bluebirds soaring joyously through a sky in which the clouds were golden with sunlight. Sometimes, like now, the beauty of the scene and the joy of the birds seemed forced, aggravatingly insistent, so that Earl wanted to get a can of spray paint and obliterate the entire panorama.\n",
      "line is: He might have vandalized it if there hadn't been security cameras in the hallways and in the elevator. But the homeowners' association would only restore it and make him pay for the work. Large sums of money no longer came to him in suitcases, in valises, in fat manila envelopes, in grocery bags, in doughnut-shop boxes, or taped to the bodies of high-priced call girls who arrived naked under leather trench coats. These days, this former senator so frequently felt the urge to deface so many things that he needed to strive to control himself lest he vandalize his way into the poorhouse.\n",
      "line is: He closed his eyes to shut out the schmaltzy scene of sun-washed bluebirds. When the air temperature abruptly dropped perhaps twenty degrees in an instant, as the car passed the second floor, Earl's eyes startled open, and he turned in bewilderment when he saw that the mural no longer surrounded him. The security camera was missing. The white wainscoting had vanished, too. No inlaid marble underfoot. In the stainless-steel ceiling, circles of opaque material shed blue light. The walls, doors, and floor were all brushed stainless steel.\n",
      "line is: Before Earl Blandon's martini-marinated brain could fully absorb and accept the elevator's transformation, the car stopped ascending—and plummeted. His stomach seemed to rise, then to sink. He stumbled sideways, clutched the handrail, and managed to remain on his feet.\n",
      "line is: The car didn't shudder or sway. No thrumming of hoist cables. No clatter of counterweights. No friction hum of rollers whisking along greased guide rails. With express-elevator speed, the steel box raced smoothly, quietly down.\n",

      "line is: What a strange answer, but it was the first one that came to mind when he looked at her. He had married too young—when he was twenty-two—and had fathered a child. He was single again and not particularly interested in women, except for an occasional roll in the hay. No woman had ever had this effect on him. He had thought these feelings were the stuff of novels and movies.\n",

      "line is: He frowned. His work was weighing on him. He was waking up in the middle of the night, haunted by visions of bloody bodies. It was impossible for him to share the anxiety that assailed him. Who could he confide in? His colleagues? From time to time they did spend an evening together, joking about dead bodies to chase away the ghosts. But nothing could keep a cop grounded better than going home to a family and reconnecting with day-to-day life. Routine puts priorities into perspective so the day's sordid experiences can be forgotten. That was why he hired married men with children. Eighty percent of his staff met these criteria. They needed this balance to withstand the pressure of the cases his elite crime-fighting squad handled. He alone did not respect this rule.\n",

      "line is: He stopped; for there shuffled round the corner, from the roaring Motee Bazar, such a man as Kim, who thought he knew all castes, had never seen. He was nearly six feet high, dressed in fold upon fold of dingy stuff like horse-blanketing, and not one fold of it could Kim refer to any known trade or profession. At his belt hung a long open-work iron pencase and a wooden rosary such as holy men wear. On his head was a gigantic sort of tam-o'-shanter. His face was yellow and wrinkled, like that of Fook Shing, the Chinese bootmaker in the bazar. His eyes turned up at the corners and looked like little slits of onyx.\n",
      "line is: High atop the Exodus Memorial in the plaza of Nuevo Santa Fe, Kimble paced back and forth, his hand raised to strike down the impudent. The Memorial had nothing to do with the early events of Judeo-Christian tradition, but there were several scriptural references on the ceramic tiles inset in the thick adobe wall, and young Orvel, whose father was the local LDS bishop, and young Martin, whose eldest brother was a deacon at the Church of Christ the Rock, argued from below that these affiliations entitled them to the place occupied by Kimble, an avowed apostate and frequent blasphemer. Alas, neither their spiritual superiority nor their physical efforts had dislodged the smaller boy from his perch.\n",
      "line is: Kimble smiled kindly down at him. \"Never while I breathe.\"\n",
      "line is: Martin stepped back to the side where Orvel was trying to form an alliance with César, an altar boy at Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe. César was bigger than any of them and might have turned the tide against Kimble, but César was having none of it. There was historical animosity. If Orvel and Martin had not previously sided against César in the affair of Mr. Romero's broken shop window (and borne false witness at that), César might have been more receptive to their appeal to Christian solidarity.\n",
      "line is: Rebuffed, Martin and Orvel steeled themselves for another attempt on the monument, a two-front assault from opposite ends of the wall. Unfortunately for them, Kimble was monkey quick, and a sudden flick of his hand toward Orvel's face sent that worthy sprawling in time for Kimble to turn and meet young Martin, pudgy and less fit, before he achieved the summit. A mild blow on Martin's grasping fingers sent him down into the dust of the plaza.\n",
      "line is: Their injuries were slight, but César's mocking laughter was like salt in a cut.\n",
      "line is: The Territorial Administrative Complex and the Territorial Rangers headquarters bordered the great square on two sides. The Commercial Galleria, a series of businesses clumped together around the main heliograph office, occupied the third side, and the fourth side held the sprawled booths of the city market, open every day but Sunday. Now, shortly after the end of siesta, people strolled the plaza and shopped.\n",
      "line is: As Kimble watched, a woman wearing goatskin boots, wide-bottomed gaucho pants, and a cotton smock walked out of the market and into the square. She was pulling a travois, a modern one, glass composite poles with a small wheel where they came together. A strap running between the two handles crossed her shoulders and helped support the modest, tarp-covered load. Though her short dark hair was peppered with gray, her face seemed young, or at least unlined.\n",
      "line is: \"Gentlemen,\" she said, apparently addressing all four of them. \"Would one of you be so kind as to tell me where the Land Registrar is?\"\n",
      "line is: Orvel, still on his bottom in the dust of the square, didn't know, and he was mortified, convinced the woman had seen his ignominious descent. Martin, following his church's creed, was unwilling to talk to a woman not of his family. César didn't know but he said politely, \"I would be glad to ask inside, ma'am.\"\n",
      "line is: \"No need,\" said Kimble. \"I know.\" He dropped lightly off the monument and rolled to absorb the impact, rising smoothly to his feet. He jerked his chin toward the fiberglass awnings of the Galleria. \"If you'll walk this way?\"\n",

      "line is: **A** musingly enough, it all began with falling for an urban legend myself. A few years ago, I wrote on my comic blog, Comics Should Be Good! about comic writer-artist Walter Simonson's run on the comic book title _Fantastic Four_ in the late 1980s and early 1990s. I made a comment regarding Simonson's distaste for the ways some writers had handled the Fantastic Four's most famous villain, Doctor Doom, over the years. Simonson had written a story that could explain away many of these appearances as having been made by impostors. I had read more than once that Simonson privately kept a list of the character's appearances that he specifically felt should be ignored. Well, sometime after my comments were published, I received an e-mail from—who else?—Walter Simonson!\n",
      "line is: Simonson kindly pointed out that he had never made any such list but that he repeatedly had heard people refer to the supposed list! Simonson specifically noted how bemused he was at the fact that he himself was the subject of an \"urban legend.\" While chagrined over my error, it occurred to me that there were plenty of comic-book-related stories out there that have been passed around for years without being checked out, so I decided it would be a great idea to either confirm or debunk them. In June 2005 I began a weekly column on the topic.\n",
      "line is: Three years and over 500 urban legends later, here we are with a collection of 130 comic book stories—65 of my favorite legends from the column plus 65 brand-new legends! Some of them are false and some of them are true, but all of them demonstrate the fascinating history of comic books.\n",
      "line is: In an effort to make it easier to find the legend you're looking for, I've split them into three parts: one for legends related to DC Comics, one for those related to Marvel Comics, and one for legends related to all the other great comic book companies out there.\n",
      "line is: All three companies published together under a loose partnership, calling themselves National Comics. Donenfeld soon bought out Wheeler-Nicholson, and in 1944 he bought out All-American Publications as well. By this time, while officially going by the name National Publications, the company was known colloquially as DC Comics, and DC is what appeared on the logos of the books. The company would not take the name officially, though, until the late 1970s.\n",
      "line is: Donenfeld and his former accountant Jack Liebowitz ran the company (though Donenfeld's son, Irwin Donenfeld, eventually took over for his father) until, in 1967, it was purchased by Kinney National Services, which quickly changed its name to Warner Bros. after it acquired the famed Warner Bros. movie studio as well. DC Comics is currently a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Entertainment, which has turned a number of its comic book properties into films and television series.\n",
      "line is: _Superman_ was soon one of the highest-selling publications in the whole country, selling over a million copies a month, and in no time every comic book company was rushing to put out its own superhero comic book. Siegel and Shuster went from being a pair of unknown teens trying to break into the comics industry to being two of the most famous creators in the United States. Eventually, though, they began to resent the fact that they had sold the rights to their character for only $130, while _Superman_ was making National Comics millions of dollars. In 1947 the pair sued National, to recoup their rights to _Superman_ , and lost. They were fired from the comic and had their \"created by\" credit stricken from the books. It was not until the late 1970s, due to public outcry over their treatment during the publicity leading to the release of _Superman: The Movie_ , that Siegel and Shuster were given a stipend for the rest of their lives (originally around $35,000 and believed to be more later on), medical benefits, and a \"created by\" credit from that point forward.\n",
      "line is: By the time the film was released, Superman had already become an American institution, with comic books, movie serials (both animated and live action), a popular radio series, and a popular television series (not to mention as many licensed products as you could imagine). The film, though, brought a brand-new wave of popularity and went on to spawn three sequels during the 1980s and a relaunch of the film franchise in 2006.\n",
      "line is: When Siegel and Shuster sold the rights to Superman in 1939, copyrights lasted for only fifty-six years (an initial twenty-eight-year period followed by a twenty-eight-year renewal period). In 1976 the United States Congress passed a new copyright act, which extended the protection period from fifty-six to seventy-five years. In part, the act allowed people (or their heirs) who sold their copyrights to cancel the transfer of their copyright and get it back for the additional nineteen years, under the theory that when they sold the copyright it was only for fifty-six years, so it would be unfair for the buyer to gain the benefit of those extra nineteen years.\n",
      "line is: AS YOU MIGHT imagine, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, as two Jewish men from Cleveland, were no fans of the Nazis during World War II, so I am sure they took great pleasure in the offer they received from _Look_ magazine in early 1940. _Look_ wanted the pair to draw a short story demonstrating how Superman would handle the war in Europe, which was still almost two years away from directly involving the United States.\n",
      "line is: Their story involves Superman getting fed up with the war, so he flies over to Europe, smacks around the German troops for a little bit, then flies into Hitler's bunker and captures Hitler. Superman then makes a stopover in the Soviet Union, to capture Stalin as well. He then flies the two men to Geneva, for a war-crimes trial before the League of Nations, where both Hitler and Stalin are found guilty of \"modern history's greatest crime—unprovoked aggression against defenseless nations.\" It is particularly interesting to note just how Stalin was viewed at the time, as presumably Siegel's take on Stalin would not be much different from the average American's prior to the uneasy alliance struck up by President Roosevelt and Stalin later in World War II.\n",

      "line is: THE SENSUOUS SCARLET GLOW from the floor lamp in the cheaply furnished room seeped under the partially closed lids of Baron's eyes, and he lay rigidly on the bed, thinking it all through one more time with a kind of fevered relentlessness. He tried to shut his mind against the harsh sounds of Elene's quick movements as she crossed and recrossed the room. He heard her hesitate before the dresser and her skirt lifted, a garter snapped against flesh, the skirt was lowered, smoothed. She cleared her throat, recommenced the nervous stalking from the wall to the scantily curtained windows overlooking the Rue Paradis and that strange, hour-lingering yellow twilight of late afternoon in Marseilles. Back and forth she stalked, to and fro, and Baron actually held his breath as he drove deep again into tight remembering. He recalled the chronologically ordered moments of the past two and a half years, perspiring and slowly thinking his way straight to this empty-handed present — to this cheap room with this cheap cocotte who somehow still possessed her soul. And to what was left of himself, Frank Baron. Even seeing it clearly, he would never admit defeat. There was too much hate for that — too much of everything.\n",
      "line is: You don't trace and seek a man for endless months, across continents, through endless cities, beyond mountains and plains, and then suddenly drop it. The insane part of it was that he really searched for a man's existence. Because he had never seen the man. A human being that existed. Somewhere....\n",
      "line is: Yes, he thought. He destroyed me. He destroyed my life. Somewhere I'll find him — someday.\n",
      "line is: Like bright black moments on a stark white screen, the tragic elements of the remembering sprang tauntingly awake, and he experienced the usual torture. Those frenzied weeks before the trials. The waiting and the cruelly patient days during which he lost his wife and his daughter, Bette. Losing Patricia, knowing she had left him, he could stand that — but Bette was something else again. The headlines, screaming, \"Traitor!\" The closed factories he had once been so proud of, and the closed bank accounts, too. All gone. Finished, like so much sand washed along a smooth curb into the sewer. Because all the time there had been inside him this howling cry, yelling at them that they were wrong. None heard. Not even that day on the witness stand, when the cry burst past his lips.\n",
      "line is: It had taken more than one hand to accomplish everything, he knew. But he also knew that a single mind had conceived the major plan. With meagerly rationed money from a single secret bank account that his understanding lawyer had arranged for him, he began the search without a clue. He had only his oath, sworn passionately to himself, of vengeance. He did not like the word itself, because it somehow cheapened the quest. But cheap or not, that's what it was. So from the environs of the closed airplane factories, from the Midwest cities, he pursued a nebulous trail of talk. And very gradually he discovered the faint, elusive, but telltale aura of a _modus operandi_. A careful rationalization of this alone led him from New York to Chicago to San Francisco, then to Mexico City and Panama and Tokyo and down through Brazil and back to New Orleans and Kansas City, tracing the dim trail of that mind's existence. Questioning everywhere. To Capetown, to Italy, then back home. To Rome and Paris and home again, with the money dwindling fast now. But with the trail sometimes brightening, almost as if that mind paused to laugh, just around the corner, allowing Baron to hear the laughter. But faintly. Then, suddenly bright, it had led him to Paris — and now Marseilles. The money was all gone now, everything he owned pawned or sold, and the trail was absolutely ended.\n",
      "line is: There was nothing left to go on. It was like carrying a pail brimming with precious water for miles, only to discover suddenly that the pail had no bottom. That there had never been any water.\n",
      "line is: Baron twisted on the bed, keeping his eyes closed and fiercely closing his mind to remembering. He did not want to remember now, only to rush skimming along the surface of things. To remember the details of each interim clearly was to go on through torture that would leave him spent, exhausted.\n",
      "line is: Elene. He had forgotten her. She meant a great deal to him and he wondered momentarily what would eventually happen to them. And as he wondered, the memories slipped away, and he began to be himself again, slowly. He relaxed, with only the ghosts haunting him. The newspapers had followed his journey quite well, but they termed it debauch. Frank Baron's death fling. Well, let them think it. To hell with everything but _him_.\n",
      "line is: \"Yes?\" He looked at her and she smiled at him with that quick motion of the head and shoulders that helped to reveal the self-conscious boldness he admired.\n",
      "line is: He said nothing, watching her. He knew she didn't like being watched. It made her move her head and shoulders still more and he liked seeing this. Scarlet touched her cheeks and her dark eyes sparkled and he wished they could go someplace far beyond far mountains. He knew he would never find a better companion, a more understanding lover. Since they had met that night in the café, she refused to leave him. She liked his nose. _She_ refused to speak of any other reason for remaining with him. \"It is your nose,\" she told him. \"It is a great, defiant nose. A strong block of a nose. A nose with character. Many persons have noses that are entertaining,\" she told him. \"But none is so interesting as your nose, _chéri_. Let it go at that, then. I am in love with your nose.\"\n",
      "line is: For his own part, he had never imagined a prostitute could be anything like Elene. He had heard the stories, but he had never met one. Not like Elene. For many days now he had refused to admit to himself that she had any calling other than their own life together. He couldn't understand why she stayed with him. He knew he was boresome. They had not eaten regularly. They were behind in their rent. Looking at her now, he wished they could always be together. If peace might ever be found, then surely Elene had helped to show him a way.\n",
